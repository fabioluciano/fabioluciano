## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer passionate about building robust, scalable, and, above all, exceptional Developer Experience (DevEx) systems. My journey in technology is driven by a continuous pursuit of efficiency, automation, and security, always aiming to empower development teams and optimize value delivery.

My expertise spans a wide range of specializations, including **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, **Software Engineering**, **Kubernetes & Containers**, and **Observability & SRE**. I have a particular focus on container orchestration with Kubernetes, cloud cost optimization, and building platforms that simplify the software development lifecycle.

I strongly believe in the culture of sharing and the power of open source. With over 3000 starred repositories and exploring thousands of unique topics, I am constantly learning and delving deeper into new technologies. I actively contribute to the community through projects, blog articles, and discussions, aiming to disseminate knowledge and foster innovation.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
My passion lies in transforming complexity into elegant and efficient solutions, with a keen eye on developer experience and operational sustainability. Currently, my main focuses include:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing resilient, scalable infrastructures and optimizing costs in cloud environments, ensuring maximum financial and operational efficiency.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating tools, processes, and environments that make development more productive, intuitive, and enjoyable for software engineers.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing and enhancing CI/CD pipelines to automate the software development lifecycle, enabling fast, secure, and reliable deliveries.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices from the early stages of development ("shift left") through operation, proactively protecting systems and data.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms that provide a self-service experience for engineering teams.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing robust and scalable solutions, with a focus on distributed architectures, code quality, and application performance.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Mastering large-scale application orchestration, managing containerized environments, and exploring the advanced capabilities of the Kubernetes ecosystem.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing strategies to ensure the health, performance, and reliability of critical systems, applying Site Reliability Engineering principles.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
Even with lighter public commit activity in the last 30 days, I remain focused on strategic and impactful projects, as well as continuous contributions via Pull Requests and discussions.

*   **[fabioluciano/kubestronaut](https://github.com/fabioluciano/kubestronaut)**: A comprehensive and practical guide to mastering Kubernetes, with a focus on preparing for the KCNA, CKA, and CKAD certifications. This project reflects my commitment to sharing knowledge and empowering other developers.
*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: The ultimate tmux status bar framework. This project demonstrates my interest in tools that enhance productivity and Developer Experience in the terminal environment.
*   **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)**: My personal blog and portfolio, built with MDX, where I share insights and detailed articles on Developer Experience, Cloud Architecture, Platform Engineering, and DevOps.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technological frontiers. With a high rate of recently starred repositories, I am immersed in several emerging areas:

*   **Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Agents**: Delving into Large Language Models (LLMs), frameworks for code agents, and personal assistants, as seen in projects like `openclaw`, `Maestro`, and `CodexBar`.
*   **Platform Engineering and Cloud Observability**: Investigating advanced tools for Kubernetes troubleshooting, log visualization, and monitoring on platforms like Google Cloud (e.g., `khi`).
*   **Container Security and Hardening**: Exploring hardened container images and best practices in DevSecOps to ensure more secure environments (e.g., `minimal`).
*   **Systems Development in Rust and Go**: Continuously improving my skills in these high-performance languages, focusing on robust infrastructure and backend systems.
*   **Self-Hosted Solutions and Privacy**: Interested in platforms that offer greater control and privacy over data and services, exploring self-hosted alternatives (e.g., `craftplan`, `feishin`).
