## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer passionate about building robust systems and optimizing the developer journey. With a career focused on transforming complex challenges into scalable and efficient solutions, my work centers on creating environments where innovation thrives and productivity is intrinsic. My current bio is "Brazilian solutions architect," and my passion extends across various fronts that ensure excellence in software delivery.

My expertise ranges from **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, where I seek to maximize cloud value with cost control, to **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, building the foundations for development teams to operate autonomously and with high performance. I am a **Developer Experience (DevEx)** enthusiast, focused on eliminating friction and improving engineers' workflows. This translates into implementing **Modern DevOps & CI/CD** practices, ensuring fast and reliable deliveries, and integrating **DevSecOps & Security** from the early stages of development.

Deeply engaged with **Software Engineering**, I dedicate myself to design patterns and architectures that promote scalability and maintainability. I have extensive experience with **Kubernetes & Containers**, orchestrating applications in cloud-native environments, and I am a proponent of **Observability & SRE**, ensuring that systems are not only functional but also reliable and easy to monitor. I actively contribute to the open-source community, developing tools like `tmux-powerkit` and educational guides like `kubestronaut`, in addition to sharing insights on DevEx on my blog.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my energy is directed towards exploring and deepening my knowledge in the following areas, always seeking innovation and optimization of processes and architectures:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing resilient, scalable, and cost-optimized architectures on leading cloud providers, with a focus on governance and financial efficiency.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Developing and implementing strategies to improve developer workflows, reduce friction, and enhance satisfaction and productivity.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: End-to-end automation, high-performance continuous delivery pipelines, and fostering a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices at all stages of the development lifecycle, automating scans, and ensuring system compliance and protection.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining internal platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity, empowering development teams to deliver value faster.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying robust design principles, evolutionary architectures, and high-quality coding practices for distributed and scalable systems.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Proficiency in container orchestration, cluster management, cloud-native application deployment, and Kubernetes environment optimization.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing (MLT) solutions, defining SLOs/SLIs, and adopting Site Reliability Engineering practices to ensure system health and performance.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
My passion for developer tools and education is evident in the projects I maintain and collaborate on:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A robust framework for `tmux` status bars, designed to elevate terminal productivity. (Shell)
*   **[fabioluciano/kubestronaut](https://github.com/fabioluciano/kubestronaut)**: A comprehensive guide to mastering Kubernetes, from basics to advanced certifications, reflecting my commitment to knowledge and community.
*   **[fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A Python tool for analyzing GitHub profile data, demonstrating my interest in automation and data-driven insights.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
Always seeking new frontiers and continuous improvement, I am actively exploring the following areas and technologies:

*   **Artificial Intelligence & LLMs for Development**: Investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI tools can optimize the software development lifecycle, from code generation to documentation and testing, with a focus on `claude-code` and `openclaw`.
*   **Programmatic Drawing and Documentation Tools**: Exploring solutions like `Typst` and `cetz` to efficiently create technical documentation and diagrams in a versionable manner, enhancing the communication of complex architectures.
*   **Universal Artifact Registries & Supply Chain Security**: Delving into `artifact-keeper` and solutions for dependency management and supply chain security to ensure the integrity of software artifacts.
*   **Container Image Hardening & Runtime Security**: Focusing on practices to create more secure container images (`minimal`) and protect production environments, strengthening the DevSecOps posture.
*   **Platform Tooling Development in Rust and Go**: Continuing to deepen my knowledge and application of Rust and Go in building high-performance infrastructure tools and platform components.
