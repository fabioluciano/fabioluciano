## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable, and efficient systems within the cloud-native ecosystem. My professional journey is driven by a continuous pursuit of innovation and the optimization of the developer experience, transforming complexity into intuitive and powerful platforms.

With extensive experience in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, and **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, I operate at the intersection of strategy and execution. My expertise extends to **Software Engineering**, **Kubernetes & Containers**, **DevSecOps & Security**, and **Observability & SRE**, ensuring that solutions are not only functional but also secure, efficient, and easy to operate. I am an enthusiast of languages like Go, Rust, Python, and TypeScript, always seeking the best tools for each challenge.

I believe that technology should empower, not complicate. That's why I actively contribute to open-source projects like `tmux-powerkit`, and share my insights on the future of software engineering and performance metrics on my blog. I am always exploring new frontiers, from cloud cost optimization to applying AI in developer productivity.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
My work and research are concentrated on key areas that drive innovation and efficiency in software development:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps:** Designing and optimizing scalable, secure, and efficient cloud infrastructures, with a focus on cost control and governance to maximize the value of cloud investments.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx):** Building platforms and tools that empower developers, reducing friction and increasing productivity, as explored in my blog and talks on the subject.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD:** Implementing robust and automated continuous delivery pipelines to streamline the software development lifecycle, ensuring fast and reliable releases.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security:** Integrating security practices from design to operation, ensuring resilient systems that comply with best practices for data and infrastructure protection.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP):** Developing Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) to abstract complexities, standardize environments, and provide a self-service experience for development teams.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering:** Building applications and systems with a focus on performance, maintainability, and scalability, using modern languages like Go, Rust, and Python for high-quality solutions.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers:** Orchestrating and managing containerized environments for high availability, elasticity, and application portability across various clouds.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE:** Implementing comprehensive monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting strategies to ensure the health, reliability, and performance of systems in production.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
My projects reflect my interest in optimizing workflows, sharing knowledge, and contributing to the community:

*   **fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit:** The ultimate `tmux` status bar framework, boasting over 450 stars and 70 forks. A testament to my focus on productivity tools and optimizing the development environment.
*   **fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com & fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com:** My personal projects that serve as a platform for sharing knowledge (blog) and applying engineering principles to document automation (resume as code, using Typst).
*   **Contributing to integr8/integr8.me:** Actively engaging in external open-source projects, contributing improvements and new features to the community.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I am constantly exploring new technologies and deepening my knowledge to stay at the forefront of software engineering:

*   🦀 **Rust & GTK/Libadwaita:** Exploring the creation of performant desktop applications with modern interfaces, as seen in music player projects (`euphonica`, `feishin`).
*   🤖 **AI Tools for Developers:** Investigating how artificial intelligence can optimize workflows, generate code, and refactor text, drawing inspiration from projects like `humanizer` and `1code`.
*   🔬 **eBPF & Container Observability:** Deepening my understanding of eBPF for advanced diagnostics and process visibility in containerized environments, as demonstrated in the `psc` project.
*   ⚡ **TUIs for Productivity:** Enhancing interaction with command-line tools and Git through terminal user interfaces (e.g., `keifu`, `xdgctl`).
*   💰 **AWS Cost Optimization:** Focusing on tools and strategies for auditing and reducing expenses in AWS environments, inspired by `aws-doctor`.
