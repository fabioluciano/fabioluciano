## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect passionate about building robust and efficient systems within the cloud-native ecosystem. With a career focused on optimizing developer experience and software delivery, I operate at the intersection of **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, and **Software Engineering**. My passion lies in transforming complex ideas into tangible solutions, ensuring scalability, security, and performance.

My expertise spans from **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, where I aim to design efficient and economically viable infrastructures, to implementing **DevSecOps & Security**, integrating security practices throughout the entire software development lifecycle. I am an enthusiast of **Kubernetes & Containers**, using them as pillars for workload orchestration and management, and I am dedicated to **Observability & SRE** to ensure the continuous health, performance, and reliability of systems in production. I believe that true innovation arises from the ability to "automate what shouldn't require effort," a philosophy that permeates my projects and contributions.

With an insatiable curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, I am always exploring new technologies and contributing to the community. My experience with Go, Rust, Python, TypeScript, and Shell scripting, combined with a keen eye for **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, allows me to create tools and processes that empower teams and drive innovation.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my efforts and studies are concentrated on the following areas, where I seek to deepen my knowledge and apply best practices:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing cloud infrastructures for high availability, scalability, and cost control.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Building tools, automations, and processes that simplify developers' workflows and boost productivity.
*   🔄 **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**: Implementing continuous integration and delivery pipelines, ensuring automation, speed, and quality in software delivery.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices from the earliest stages of the development cycle, protecting applications and infrastructures.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing and maintaining robust internal platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity, empowering product teams.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying principles and design patterns to build resilient, maintainable, and high-performance systems.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Advanced orchestration and management of containerized workloads, exploring the cloud-native ecosystem.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing to ensure the health, performance, and reliability of systems in production.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
I am always involved in projects that challenge me and allow me to explore new technologies and concepts:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A robust framework for creating custom status bars in `tmux`, boasting over 430 stars and 70 forks.
*   **[integr8/integr8.me](https://github.com/integr8/integr8.me)**: Actively contributing to this external TypeScript project, focused on system integration.
*   **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)** & **[fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)**: My personal projects to automate my digital presence and resume, utilizing Astro and Typst.
*   **[fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A Python project to analyze and generate insights about GitHub profiles, reflecting my interest in tooling and data.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My learning journey is continuous, with a focus on technologies and concepts shaping the future of development and operations:

*   **Cloud-Native Secrets Management**: Deepening my understanding of `external-secrets` and `secrets-manager` to strengthen security posture in Kubernetes environments.
*   **Terminal User Interfaces (TUI)**: Exploring tools like `taws` in Rust for a more efficient cloud management experience via the terminal.
*   **Automation with AI Agents**: Investigating the use of AI agents for task automation with projects like `tally` (Python) and `vibium` (Go).
*   **Typography and Document Automation**: Utilizing `Typst` for programmatically creating high-quality documents.
*   **macOS Productivity Tools**: Exploring utilities such as `Rectangle` and `MacThrottle` to optimize my workstation and monitor performance.
