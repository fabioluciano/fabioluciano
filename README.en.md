## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer passionate about building and optimizing robust and efficient systems. With a solid foundation in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, my focus is on designing scalable and economically viable infrastructures, ensuring technology intelligently serves business objectives.

My professional journey is driven by a continuous pursuit of excellence in **Software Engineering**, applying **Modern DevOps & CI/CD** principles to streamline development and delivery cycles. I have a deep commitment to **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, creating environments and tools that empower teams to be more productive and satisfied. This is reflected in projects like `tmux-powerkit`, a popular tool that enhances the terminal experience for developers.

I am a fervent advocate for security and resilience, embedding **DevSecOps & Security** at every stage of the software lifecycle. My expertise in **Platform Engineering (IDP)** and **Kubernetes & Containers** allows me to build and manage self-service platforms that simplify the operation of complex systems. I complement this with strong knowledge in **Observability & SRE**, ensuring applications are effectively monitored and services maintain high availability and performance. I'm an Open Source enthusiast, always exploring and contributing to the community.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, I'm immersed in several fronts, always seeking to improve and apply best practices in:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing elastic, secure, and cost-efficient infrastructures in public and hybrid cloud environments.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Crafting tools, workflows, and platforms that empower developers, making the software building and delivery process smoother and more enjoyable.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing continuous integration and delivery pipelines that automate, accelerate, and ensure software quality from code to production.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices across all phases of the development lifecycle, protecting applications and infrastructures against threats.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that abstract infrastructure complexity, allowing product teams to innovate faster.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying software design principles, patterns, and best practices to build scalable, maintainable, and high-performance systems.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating large-scale applications with Kubernetes, optimizing resource utilization, and ensuring service resilience and portability.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to gain deep visibility into system behavior and ensure operational reliability.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
My recent activity focuses on enhancing productivity tools and exploring new technological frontiers:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: Maintaining and expanding this popular framework for the tmux status bar, focused on providing a richer and more informative terminal experience.
*   **[fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)**: Exploring the use of Typst for document automation, applying engineering principles to optimize resume creation.
*   **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)**: Developing my personal website using Astro, with a focus on performance and user experience.
*   **Contributing to [integr8/integr8.me](https://github.com/integr8/integr8.me)**: Actively involved in external contributions, as demonstrated by my 10 recently created Pull Requests to this project.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I am always seeking new knowledge and technologies to expand my toolkit. My recent interests include:

*   **AI Agents and Orchestration**: Exploring frameworks like `oh-my-claudecode` to understand and apply the potential of AI agents in task automation and code development.
*   **Rust for Embedded Systems**: Delving deeper into the use of Rust for embedded and asynchronous systems development with `embassy-rs`, aiming for performance and security in hardware.
*   **Kubernetes Optimization and Management**: Studying tools like `kubernetes-sigs/descheduler` and `project-zot/zot` to enhance scheduling, image management, and efficiency of Kubernetes clusters.
*   **Declarative Configuration and GitOps**: Investigating languages like Jsonnet (`google/jsonnet`) and tools like Updatecli (`updatecli/updatecli`) to manage configurations and dependencies declaratively and automatically.
*   **System Security and Hardening**: Focusing on infrastructure hardening practices with tools like `dev-sec/ansible-collection-hardening`, reinforcing security in Linux and network environments.
