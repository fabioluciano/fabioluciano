### 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a technology enthusiast focused on building and optimizing robust and efficient development ecosystems. As a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer, I'm dedicated to demystifying complexities and paving the way for continuous innovation, empowering teams to deliver value quickly, securely, and sustainably.

My professional journey is driven by the relentless pursuit of excellence in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, **Software Engineering**, **Kubernetes & Containers**, and **Observability & SRE**. With deep immersion in cloud-native technologies, container orchestration, and automation, I am a proponent of practices that promote agility and resilience.

I have extensive experience with languages like Go, Rust, Python, and TypeScript, which allows me to navigate different layers of the technology stack, from low-level infrastructure to automation tools and APIs. I believe that engineering goes beyond code, encompassing process optimization and knowledge sharing, as demonstrated by my contributions to the open-source community and blog articles.

### 🎯 Current Focus & Interests

Currently, I am deeply engaged in and exploring the following areas:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing scalable and resilient infrastructures in multi-cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP), with a strong emphasis on financial governance and cost optimization.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating tools, platforms, and "golden paths" that simplify developers' workflows, increasing their productivity and satisfaction.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing automated continuous delivery pipelines and GitOps strategies to ensure fast, secure, and repeatable deployments.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices at every stage of the development lifecycle, from static code analysis to runtime protection.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) that abstract infrastructure complexity, accelerating software delivery and promoting self-service.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing robust and high-performance solutions, focusing on distributed systems design, microservices, and efficient APIs.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating large-scale applications, managing clusters, optimizing container usage, and exploring the Kubernetes ecosystem.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing systems to ensure the health, reliability, and performance of systems in production.

### 🚀 Projects in Development

Currently, I am engaged in:

*   **fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit**: Maintaining and evolving this robust framework for the `tmux` status bar, focusing on modularity and customization. (Shell)
*   **fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com**: Developing and enhancing my personal website and blog, utilizing **Astro** for a modern and performant experience.
*   **integr8/integr8.me**: Actively contributing to this open-source project, exploring **TypeScript** and integration practices for distributed systems.
*   **fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer**: A personal project in **Python** for analyzing and visualizing GitHub profile data, exploring automation and insights.

### 🌱 Currently Learning

My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technologies and approaches. I am currently deepening my knowledge in:

*   **Go** and **Rust** for developing CLI tools and low-level automation, as shown by my recent stars in `taws`, `witr`, and `vibium`.
*   Advanced secrets management in Kubernetes with **External Secrets** and other DevSecOps solutions.
*   Browser automation and AI agents, exploring projects like `VibiumDev/vibium`.
*   New approaches to terminal productivity and `tmux` environment management with tools like `tmux-fzf`.
*   Performance optimization and window management tools on **macOS** (`MacThrottle`, `Rectangle`).
