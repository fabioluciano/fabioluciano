## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable, and efficient systems. My professional journey is driven by the constant pursuit of excellence in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, where I optimize costs and performance in cloud environments, and in **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, creating tools and infrastructures that empower developers.

With a keen eye for **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, I'm dedicated to simplifying workflows while driving the adoption of **Modern DevOps & CI/CD** for fast and secure deliveries. Security is intrinsic to my work, with strong involvement in **DevSecOps & Security**, and my solid foundation in **Software Engineering** allows me to design and implement high-quality solutions. I am an enthusiast of **Kubernetes & Containers**, orchestrating microservices with mastery, and I ensure operational stability through **Observability & SRE** practices.

With over 3000 starred repositories, I am a tireless explorer of new technologies and an active advocate for the open-source ecosystem, always seeking the best practices and innovations to apply in my projects and contributions. My recent activity, with multiple Pull Requests and issue comments, reflects my commitment to collaboration and continuous improvement.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my focus and passion lie in the following areas, where I aim to deepen my knowledge and apply innovative solutions:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps:** Designing resilient infrastructures and optimizing costs in public and hybrid cloud environments, ensuring scalability and efficiency.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx):** Building tools, automations, and processes that make developers' lives more productive, intuitive, and enjoyable.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD:** Implementing continuous integration and delivery pipelines that automate the software lifecycle, promoting agility and reliability.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security:** Integrating security from the early stages of development through to operation, ensuring compliance, protection, and resilience against threats.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP):** Developing Internal Developer Platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity, accelerate development, and empower teams.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering:** Designing and implementing robust, scalable, and high-performance software solutions, with a focus on clean and maintainable code.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers:** Orchestrating and managing applications in containerized environments for maximum efficiency, resilience, and portability.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE:** Implementing proactive monitoring, logging, and tracing to ensure the health, reliability, and continuous performance of systems.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
My dedication to tool development and open-source collaboration is evident in the following projects:

*   **tmux-powerkit:** Maintainer of [tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit), a robust framework for the tmux status bar, used by hundreds of developers to optimize their terminals.
*   **Resume Automation with Typst:** Exploring the engineering behind generating professional documents with [Typst](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com), as detailed in my blog, turning resume creation into an engineering exercise.
*   **Collaboration on integr8.me:** Actively collaborating on the [integr8/integr8.me](https://github.com/integr8/integr8.me) project, contributing to a platform that aims to simplify system integration and enhance developer experience.
*   **github-profile-analyzer:** Developing tools like [github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer) in Python for analyzing and optimizing GitHub profiles, reflecting my interest in development metadata.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I am always seeking new knowledge and technologies. Currently, my areas of exploration include:

*   **Rust & TUI Development:** Deepening my understanding of terminal user interface (TUI) development with Rust, inspired by projects like `huseyinbabal/taws` to build efficient command-line tools.
*   **External Secrets & Kubernetes Security:** Diving into advanced strategies for secret management in Kubernetes environments, focusing on `external-secrets` and `secrets-manager` practices to bolster application security.
*   **Automation with AI Agents:** Investigating the potential of AI agents for task automation and workflow optimization, drawing insights from projects like `davidfowl/tally` and `VibiumDev/vibium`.
*   **Internal Developer Platforms (IDP):** Researching best practices and tools for building and evolving platforms that significantly enhance developer experience and software delivery.
*   **Swift & macOS Productivity Tools:** Exploring the development of macOS utilities and productivity tools using Swift, as observed in `rxhanson/Rectangle` and `angristan/MacThrottle`.
