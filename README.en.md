## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer based in Brasília, Brazil. My professional journey is driven by a continuous pursuit of efficiency, scalability, and security in complex systems. With extensive experience in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, and **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, I am dedicated to building and optimizing infrastructures that empower development teams and ensure application resilience.

I am a strong advocate for **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, constantly seeking to streamline workflows and enhance developer productivity. My expertise also extends to **DevSecOps & Security**, ensuring that security practices are intrinsic to the software lifecycle, and **Software Engineering**, where I apply robust design principles to create high-quality solutions. I possess deep knowledge in **Kubernetes & Containers** for workload orchestration and in **Observability & SRE** to keep critical systems operational and performant.

While my commit activity on public repositories may appear light, I am an active contributor to discussions, code reviews, and the exploration of new technologies, always seeking the best tools and approaches to solve complex challenges. I am the maintainer of the popular `tmux-powerkit` and author of several technical articles on my blog, reflecting my commitment to sharing knowledge and fostering the community.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my main areas of focus and interest include:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing cloud infrastructures (multi-cloud) for maximum efficiency, scalability, and cost control, ensuring intelligent cloud financial management.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Improving the developer journey by automating repetitive tasks, enhancing tools and processes to boost team productivity and satisfaction.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing and refining Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that promote automation, agility, and reliability in the software lifecycle.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices from the early stages of development through operation, using automation to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms that offer self-service tools and services for engineering teams.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing robust, efficient, and high-quality software solutions, applying clean design principles and best coding practices.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Specializing in the orchestration and management of containerized applications, including the design, deployment, and optimization of Kubernetes clusters across different environments.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions, and applying Site Reliability Engineering principles to ensure high availability and performance of critical systems.

## 🚀 Ongoing Projects
I am actively involved in personal and collaborative projects that reflect my interest in tooling, automation, and system architecture:

*   **fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit**: Maintainer of a `tmux` status bar framework, boasting over 400 stars, demonstrating my interest in productivity tools and development environment customization.
*   **fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com**: Exploring the use of Typst to automate the generation and maintenance of my resume, as an exercise in software engineering and automation.
*   **fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer**: A personal Python project for analyzing GitHub profiles, showcasing my interest in data and tools for optimizing online presence.
*   **Contributing to integr8/integr8.me**: Actively contributing Pull Requests to this external project, reinforcing my engagement with the open-source community.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technologies and concepts. I am currently deepening my knowledge in:

*   **AI Agents & Orchestration**: Exploring frameworks like `oh-my-claudecode` to understand and apply multi-agent systems and intelligent automation.
*   **Rust for Embedded Systems & Backend**: Diving into `embassy-rs/embassy` and `rustmailer/bichon` to explore Rust's potential in embedded systems contexts and high-performance backend service development.
*   **C/Linux System Programming**: Reviewing fundamentals with `stewartweiss/intro-linux-sys-prog` to enhance my understanding of how operating systems work at a low level.
*   **Declarative Updates & GitOps**: Studying tools like `updatecli/updatecli` to manage dependencies and configurations declaratively in GitOps environments.
*   **System Hardening & Security**: Delving into `dev-sec/ansible-collection-hardening` to implement robust security practices in Linux infrastructures and services like SSH and Nginx.
*   **OCI-native Container Registries**: Exploring `project-zot/zot` to understand container registry solutions that align with OCI and Kubernetes standards.
