### 👋 About Me

I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer with a passion for building and optimizing development and infrastructure ecosystems. My professional journey is driven by the pursuit of efficiency, scalability, and an exceptional developer experience. With a holistic view, I operate at the intersection of various disciplines to transform ideas into robust solutions.

My expertise deeply covers **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, ensuring that solutions are not only functional but also economically viable. I am a tireless advocate for **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, creating tools and processes that empower teams to be more productive. With a strong background in **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**, I automate and optimize delivery pipelines, and integrate security from the outset through **DevSecOps & Security** practices. I am an enthusiast of **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, building internal platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity. Furthermore, I apply **Software Engineering** principles to ensure code quality and system design, with a particular focus on **Kubernetes & Containers** for orchestration and cloud-native application management, and **Observability & SRE** to maintain system reliability and performance.

I am a constant explorer of new technologies, with over 3000 starred repositories and thousands of unique topics explored. I believe in the strength of community and collaboration, actively contributing to open-source projects and sharing my knowledge through technical articles.

### 🎯 Current Focus & Interests

Currently, my energy is concentrated on:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing resilient and scalable cloud infrastructures, with a focus on cost optimization and financial governance.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Crafting environments and tools that make the development lifecycle more fluid, intuitive, and productive for engineers.
*   🔄 **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**: Implementing end-to-end continuous integration and delivery pipelines, promoting automation and a culture of collaboration.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices into all phases of development and operations, from conception to production, to build more secure systems.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing and maintaining internal platforms that serve as a foundation for development teams, abstracting complexities and accelerating delivery.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying software design principles, clean architecture, and coding standards to build robust, maintainable, and high-quality systems.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Deepening knowledge in container orchestration, cluster management, and the vast cloud-native ecosystem.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to ensure system health and reliability, applying Site Reliability Engineering principles.

### 🚀 Projects in Development

I'm always working on something new or refining existing projects:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: The Ultimate tmux Status Bar Framework (Shell). My most prominent project, a robust framework for customizing and enhancing the tmux status bar, with an active community of users and contributors.
*   **[integr8/integr8.me](https://github.com/integr8/integr8.me)**: Contributing to this external project in TypeScript, exploring integration and automation solutions.
*   **[fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A personal Python project to analyze and optimize GitHub profiles, reflecting my interest in automation and data.
*   **[fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)**: My resume as code, using Typst for document automation and exploring new composition tools.

### 🌱 Currently Learning

I am constantly exploring new technologies and enhancing my skills, with a recent focus on:

*   **Rust**: Diving deeper into command-line tool development and system utilities, as seen in projects like `taws` (Terminal UI for AWS).
*   **External Secrets Operator**: Exploring solutions for Kubernetes secret management, an emerging topic in cloud-native security.
*   **AI Agents & Browser Automation**: Investigating the use of artificial intelligence for task automation and browser interactions, as in `tally` and `vibium`.
*   **Typst**: Mastering this new document composition language to create technical materials and resumes efficiently and elegantly.
*   **Modern CLI/TUI Tools**: Exploring the creation and use of terminal user interfaces to enhance productivity and developer experience.
