## 👋 About Me
Fábio Luciano is a Cloud Solutions Architect with a career focused on building robust, efficient, and scalable infrastructures. With a strategic vision, he is dedicated to optimizing the developer experience (DevEx), ensuring that teams can deliver value quickly and securely. His expertise spans orchestrating environments with Kubernetes & Containers, implementing modern DevOps & CI/CD, and securing systems through DevSecOps & Security.

Beyond his proficiency in Software Engineering and Platform Engineering (IDP), Fábio is a FinOps enthusiast, constantly seeking ways to maximize cloud value while minimizing costs. His passion for Observability & SRE reflects his commitment to maintaining resilient and high-performing systems, always with a focus on business outcomes.

With an exploratory profile, evidenced by over 2800 "starred" repositories and a vast range of topics investigated, Fábio demonstrates a continuous interest in staying up-to-date and exploring the frontiers of technology, especially in languages like Go and Rust, and in areas such as security and command-line tools.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing scalable infrastructures and optimizing costs in cloud environments, ensuring efficiency and financial governance.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating tools and processes that simplify developers' workflows, increasing productivity and satisfaction.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing robust, automated, and efficient continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines to accelerate the software development lifecycle.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices into all phases of the development cycle, from design to operation, to build systems resilient to threats.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing and maintaining internal platforms that empower development teams, abstracting infrastructure complexity.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying principles and patterns to build high-quality, performant, and easily maintainable software solutions.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating large-scale applications with Kubernetes and utilizing containers to ensure portability and consistency across various environments.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to gain deep insights into system behavior and ensure their reliability.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
While recent public activity in terms of commits is light, Fábio demonstrates an intense interest in exploring new tools and technologies, with a notable focus on:
*   **Cloud Cost Optimization:** Investigating solutions like `aws-doctor` (Go) to diagnose and optimize AWS spending, reflecting his FinOps expertise.
*   **Developer Productivity Tools:** Exploring TUIs (Text User Interfaces) for Git (`keifu` in Rust) and application management (`xdgctl` in C), aiming to enhance the developer experience in the terminal.
*   **Networking and Distributed Systems:** Following projects like `Reticulum` (Python), which explores cryptography-based networks, and `psc` (Go), a `ps` utility with eBPF and container context, indicating an interest in low-level systems and networking.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
The vast collection of starred repositories and emerging topics indicates continuous learning, with a focus on:
*   **Rust and Go for System Tools:** Deepening expertise in high-performance languages for building command-line utilities, system tools, and infrastructure.
*   **Platform Engineering and DevEx:** Exploring the creation of internal platforms and tools that improve the developer experience, such as user interfaces for AI (`1code`, `openwork` in TypeScript).
*   **Security and System Protection:** With "protection" emerging as a topic, there's a clear interest in strengthening the security and resilience of environments and applications.
*   **Automation and Optimization:** Seeking new approaches to automate complex tasks and optimize resource utilization, both in the cloud and in development workflows.
