## 👋 About Me
Fábio Luciano is a Brazilian solutions architect passionate about building robust, scalable, and secure systems. With extensive experience in software engineering, he specializes in optimizing Developer Experience (DevEx) and enhancing continuous delivery through modern DevOps and CI/CD practices. His work extends to Cloud Architecture, where he applies FinOps principles to ensure efficiency and governance, and to Platform Engineering, designing and implementing Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that empower development teams.

Deeply committed to security, Fábio integrates DevSecOps throughout the entire software development lifecycle, ensuring security is a consideration from design to operation. He is an enthusiast of container technologies and orchestration with Kubernetes, and a strong advocate for Observability and SRE to maintain system health and performance. As the maintainer of the popular `tmux-powerkit`, he demonstrates his commitment to the open-source community and to creating tools that enhance developer productivity.

His work reflects a continuous pursuit of technical excellence and a strategic vision for transforming complex challenges into efficient solutions. He believes that technology should serve to empower individuals and teams, driving innovation responsibly and with a focus on value.
