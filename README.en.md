## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer with a deep passion for transforming development and operations environments. My professional journey focuses on building robust, scalable, and secure systems, always with a keen eye on developer experience (DevEx) and operational efficiency. With a solid foundation in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, and **Platform Engineering**, I constantly strive to apply best practices to elevate the quality and speed of software delivery.

I am a Cloud Native enthusiast, specializing in **Kubernetes & Containers**, and I am dedicated to integrating security from the early stages of the development lifecycle through **DevSecOps & Security**. I believe that excellence in **Software Engineering** is achieved when combined with a culture of **Observability & SRE**, ensuring that systems not only function but are resilient and understandable.

My experience is marked by creating tools and guides that empower other developers, such as my `tmux-powerkit` project and the `kubestronaut` guide. With over 50 public repositories and extensive exploration of topics, I am always immersed in new technologies, seeking innovative solutions, and contributing to the open-source community.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, I am deeply engaged in and exploring the following areas:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing cloud infrastructures for maximum efficiency and cost-effectiveness, ensuring alignment with business objectives.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating environments, tools, and processes that empower developers, reducing friction and increasing productivity and satisfaction.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing automated pipelines and collaborative cultures for fast, reliable, and high-quality software deliveries.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices into all phases of the development lifecycle (Shift-Left Security), from design to operation.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) to simplify the consumption of infrastructure and services, accelerating product development.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying design, architecture, and coding principles to build high-quality, scalable, maintainable, and performant software.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating applications in containerized environments, mastering the complexity of the Kubernetes ecosystem for efficient and resilient deployments.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting strategies to ensure system health, performance, reliability, and responsiveness.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
Even with lighter commit activity recently on public repositories, my focus has been on strategic contributions, open-source project maintenance, and exploring new tools. Some active projects and areas of interest I am working on or exploring include:

*   **fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit**: A robust framework for the `tmux` status bar, with 471 stars and 76 forks. I continue to enhance this tool to maximize terminal productivity and customization.
*   **fabioluciano/kubestronaut**: A comprehensive guide to mastering Kubernetes and preparing for certifications like KCNA, CKA, and CKAD. It reflects my commitment to sharing knowledge and empowering the Cloud Native community.
*   **fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com**: My personal website and blog, built with MDX, where I share insights on Developer Experience, platform engineering, and productivity.
*   **Artifact Registry Exploration**: Following projects like `artifact-keeper` (Rust), a universal artifact registry, to understand the latest trends in dependency management, security, and supply chain automation.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technologies and approaches. Currently, I am focused on:

*   **Rust in the Cloud Native Ecosystem**: Deepening the use of Rust for infrastructure tools, high-performance systems, and security, as seen in artifact registry projects and hardening tools.
*   **Artificial Intelligence & Personal Tools**: Exploring how AI can enhance developer experience and automation, with interest in personal assistants and LLM-based coding tools (as indicated by `openclaw` and emerging topics like `claude-code`).
*   **Developer Tooling (DX) Development**: Investigating new VSCode extensions (`vscode-codeimg`), coding fonts (`maple-font`), and Git GUI frameworks (`git-cola`), always aiming to optimize workflows and the aesthetics of the development environment.
*   **Advanced Typography and Documentation**: Experimenting with tools like `Typst` and packages like `cetz` to create more visual, precise, and impactful technical documentation.
*   **Container Image Security**: Analyzing approaches for minimalist and CVE-hardened container images, as exemplified by the `minimal` project, aiming to strengthen the security posture in production environments.
