## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect with a deep passion for transforming how engineering teams deliver value. My professional journey is focused on optimizing Developer Experience (DevEx) and building robust, scalable platforms, ensuring that infrastructure and processes support continuous innovation.

With consolidated expertise in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, and **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, I design and implement solutions that not only accelerate development but also ensure security and cost efficiency. I am an enthusiast of **Kubernetes & Containers**, leveraging these technologies to create resilient and flexible environments, complementing my work in **Software Engineering** and **Observability & SRE** to guarantee high-performance and availability systems.

I am a proponent of open source, maintaining projects like `tmux-powerkit` and contributing to the community with detailed guides on Kubernetes. I believe that combining cutting-edge technology with a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement is key to success in modern engineering environments.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, I am immersed in challenges involving the following areas, always seeking best practices and innovations:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing scalable and resilient cloud infrastructures, with a focus on cost optimization and financial governance to maximize ROI.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Enhancing the developer journey from code to production through tools, processes, and culture that boost productivity and satisfaction.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing automated and efficient continuous delivery pipelines, fostering a culture of collaboration between development and operations.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices into all phases of the development lifecycle, ensuring systems are secure by design.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that abstract infrastructure complexity, empowering teams to focus on business logic.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing robust, performant, and easily maintainable systems, applying modern software design and architecture principles.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating large-scale applications with Kubernetes, Docker, and other containerization technologies for high availability and portability.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to ensure full visibility into systems and enhance reliability and performance.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
My dedication to open source and platform engineering is reflected in the projects I maintain and am actively involved in:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A comprehensive framework for the tmux status bar, focused on customization and productivity. Developed in Shell, with an active user community (⭐ 473).
*   **[fabioluciano/kubestronaut](https://github.com/fabioluciano/kubestronaut)**: A complete guide for those looking to master Kubernetes and earn certifications like KCNA and CKA. It reflects my commitment to sharing knowledge and fostering the Cloud Native community.
*   **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)**: My personal website and blog, where I publish insights on software engineering, DevEx, DevOps, and Cloud. Built with MDX, it's a space to explore and document my ideas.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I am constantly exploring new technologies and refining my skills to stay ahead in the tech landscape. Currently, I am focused on:

*   **Rust for Infrastructure Tools**: Deepening my understanding of Rust for developing low-level, high-performance tools, as demonstrated by my interest in `artifact-keeper`.
*   **Artificial Intelligence & Code Automation**: Exploring AI frameworks and assistants to optimize development workflows, with a focus on `claude-code` and tools like `openclaw`.
*   **Modern Web Architectures (Payload CMS)**: Investigating Payload CMS and its fullstack capabilities with Next.js and TypeScript for headless content management solutions and modern web applications.
*   **Advanced Observability in Kubernetes**: Diving into tools like `khi` (Kubernetes log viewer) to enhance diagnostic and troubleshooting capabilities in distributed environments.
*   **Font Design and Developer Tools**: Exploring the impact of tools like `maple-font` and `vscode-codeimg` on developer experience, aligned with my focus on DevEx.
