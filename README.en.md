## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer with a passion for transforming how engineering teams work. With extensive experience in building and scaling systems, my primary focus lies in creating environments where innovation thrives through optimized Developer Experience (DevEx) and robust infrastructure.

I specialize in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, and **Platform Engineering (IDP)**. My approach deeply integrates **Software Engineering** with the management of complex systems, leveraging **Kubernetes & Containers** for orchestration and **Observability & SRE** to ensure continuous reliability and performance.

I believe that developer productivity and satisfaction are the cornerstones of any product's success, and I am dedicated to demystifying complexity, driving efficiency and security throughout the software development lifecycle.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests

Currently, my energy is directed towards the following areas, always seeking to enhance value delivery and the engineering experience:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing scalable and resilient cloud infrastructures, with a keen eye on cost optimization and financial governance.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Crafting tools and processes that streamline developers' workflows, reducing friction and boosting satisfaction and productivity.
*   🔄 **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**: Implementing continuous delivery pipelines and DevOps practices to automate and accelerate the software development lifecycle.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security from the earliest stages of development, ensuring applications and infrastructures are robust against threats.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building internal developer platforms that provide self-service tools and services, accelerating innovation.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing high-quality software solutions, focusing on design, performance, and maintainability.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating workloads in containerized environments to ensure scalability, resilience, and portability.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing strategies to guarantee system health and proactively respond to incidents.

## 🚀 Projects in Development

While much of my recent work focuses on internal and strategic projects, I maintain some public repositories that reflect my interests in developer tools and automation:

*   **[tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A robust framework for creating custom status bars in `tmux`, widely used by the community to optimize the terminal environment.
*   **[cv.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/cv.fabioluciano.com)**: My professional resume, developed with `Typst`, reflecting an interest in modern document generation tools and personal branding automation.
*   **[github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A `Python` tool for GitHub profile analysis, demonstrating my interest in extracting data insights and optimizing developers' digital presence.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technological frontiers. I am currently deepening my knowledge in:

*   **AI Agents and LLMs**: Exploring the integration of large language models (LLMs) and AI agents for development task automation and workflow optimization (as evidenced by stars in `claude-code`, `codex`, `Maestro`).
*   **Advanced Observability for Kubernetes**: Investigating tools like `khi` (GoogleCloudPlatform) for log visualization and troubleshooting in Kubernetes environments, enhancing incident response capabilities.
*   **Self-Hosted Platform Engineering**: Following projects like `craftplan` and `feishin` to understand best practices in self-hosted systems, from ERPs to music players.
*   **Tool Development with Rust and TypeScript**: Exploring the potential of `Rust` for creative coding (`nannou`) and `TypeScript` for building AI tools and rich interfaces.
