## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Cloud Solutions Architect with a deep passion for optimizing developer experience and building robust platforms. With extensive experience in software engineering, my journey has led me to focus on the intersection of technology and human efficiency, ensuring that teams can deliver value continuously and securely.

My expertise ranges from **Cloud Architecture & FinOps** to implementing **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, with a keen eye on **DevSecOps & Security**. I am a dedicated advocate for **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, always seeking to create environments that empower developer productivity and autonomy, and a specialist in **Kubernetes & Containers**, orchestrating complex systems with resilience and scalability.

I believe that **Developer Experience (DevEx)** is key to high-performing teams. Through a strategic approach to **Observability & SRE**, I aim not only to build systems but also to ensure they are understandable, sustainable, and provide rapid feedback to their operators. My passion for **Software Engineering** drives me to constantly seek elegant and efficient solutions for the most complex challenges.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my efforts and research are concentrated on the following areas, aiming to improve how we build and operate software:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing scalable, resilient, and cost-optimized infrastructures, transforming the cloud into a strategic differentiator.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Crafting workflows that empower developers, minimize friction, and maximize satisfaction and productivity.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing continuous delivery pipelines that automate, accelerate, and ensure the quality of the software lifecycle.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices across all phases of development and operations, building robust and secure-by-design systems.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing internal platforms that provide tools, services, and patterns for engineering teams, accelerating innovation and standardizing infrastructure.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Designing and implementing high-quality, scalable, and maintainable software solutions, with a focus on Clean Code principles and distributed architectures.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating applications in containerized environments, ensuring high availability, scalability, and efficient resource management.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing strategies to gain deep insights into system behavior and ensure their reliability and performance.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
While recent focus has been on strategic initiatives and research, I maintain and explore personal projects that reflect my interests in tooling and productivity:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A robust framework for the tmux status bar, focused on productivity and customization for terminal environments.
*   **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)**: My personal website and blog, built with MDX, where I share insights on technology, DevEx, and engineering.
*   **[fabioluciano/cv.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/cv.fabioluciano.com)**: A project demonstrating the use of Typst for document creation, highlighting my interest in productivity tools and document automation.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technological frontiers. Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in:

*   🤖 **AI Agents & LLMs**: Exploring tools and frameworks for orchestrating and developing Artificial Intelligence agents, as evidenced by recent starred repositories related to `claude-code` and `codex`.
*   🏠 **Self-Hosted Solutions & Personal Ecosystems**: Investigating approaches to manage and optimize self-hosted software environments, from music players to business management tools.
*   🛠️ **Productivity & Personal Development Tools**: Diving into new tools to enhance workflow, including text editors, Git GUIs, and creative coding frameworks in Rust.
*   🔒 **Container Security & Hardening**: Focusing on practices to create minimalist and secure container images, aiming to reduce the attack surface and comply with CVEs.
