## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect with a passion for building robust systems and optimizing the developer journey. My career has led me to deeply explore areas such as **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, **Software Engineering**, **Kubernetes & Containers**, and **Observability & SRE**. I believe that technical excellence goes hand-in-hand with efficient processes and a culture that empowers developers.

My expertise is demonstrated in creating scalable and secure infrastructures, automating workflows, and building platforms that remove friction and enhance team productivity. I'm an open-source enthusiast, actively contributing and exploring new tools that can add value, as evidenced by the success of my `tmux-powerkit` project. With over 3000 starred repositories, I'm always seeking new ideas and innovative solutions.

Currently, I'm dedicated to deepening the connections between organizational health, team performance, and software delivery quality, as I discuss on my blog. My curiosity drives me to explore the frontiers of artificial intelligence and its practical applications in the software engineering world, always aiming to create more effective and collaborative environments.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
My professional journey is driven by a continuous pursuit of innovation and optimization across various fronts of software engineering and infrastructure:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Developing strategies to design, implement, and manage scalable, resilient, and secure cloud infrastructures, with a critical eye on cost optimization and financial efficiency in multi-cloud environments.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Focused on enhancing the developer's journey, from onboarding to production delivery, through intuitive tools, streamlined processes, and a culture that values flow and continuous feedback.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing and refining automation practices for continuous integration and delivery pipelines, aiming to accelerate the software lifecycle, ensure quality, and reduce time-to-market.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security as a fundamental pillar at every stage of software development, from design and coding to deployment and operation, ensuring robust systems protected against threats.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Designing and building Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that empower development teams, providing self-service tools and abstractions for complex infrastructure.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying software design principles, architecture, and best practices to build scalable, performant, maintainable, and high-quality systems, focusing on solutions that solve real problems.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Specialized in container orchestration with Kubernetes and the ecosystem of related technologies, to efficiently and resiliently build and manage cloud-native applications.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to gain deep visibility into system behavior. Applying Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles to ensure service reliability, performance, and availability.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
Even with light public commit activity recently, my focus has been on maintaining key projects and exploring new technologies:

*   **[tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: Maintainer of this tmux status bar framework, which continues to be a popular tool for developers looking to optimize their terminal environment.
*   **[fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)**: My personal website and blog, built with MDX, where I share insights on software engineering, DevEx, and architecture.
*   **[cv.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/cv.fabioluciano.com)**: A personal project to manage my resume using Typst, demonstrating an interest in modern typography tools and document automation.
*   **[github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A Python project reflecting my interest in data analysis and how developer profiles can be optimized and understood.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technological frontiers, with a particular focus on:

*   **AI Agents & Generative AI**: Diving deeper into frameworks like `Maestro` and exploring the use of models such as OpenAI Codex and Claude Code for automation and assistance in software development, including agents for Neovim.
*   **Rust & Go for High-Performance Tools and Systems**: Investigating the use of these languages to build command-line interface (CLI) tools, backend systems, and infrastructure utilities, as seen in projects like `euphonica` (Rust) and `aws-doctor` (Go).
*   **Cloud Cost Optimization (FinOps)**: Exploring tools and strategies for AWS cost diagnostics and idle resource detection, reinforcing expertise in FinOps.
*   **Productivity Tools & TUI**: Continuously enhancing my understanding of terminal tools and text-based user interfaces (TUI) to optimize development workflows, exemplified by `xdgctl` and `git-cola`.
*   **Networking and Decentralized Mesh Networks**: Exploring projects like `Reticulum`, which address cryptography-based mesh networks, showing an interest in low-level and resilient communication technologies.
