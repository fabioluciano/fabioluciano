## 👋 About Me
I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect with a passion for building robust and efficient systems within the Cloud Native ecosystem. My professional journey is marked by a continuous pursuit of innovation and the optimization of the developer experience. With extensive expertise spanning **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, **Software Engineering**, **Kubernetes & Containers**, and **Observability & SRE**, I am dedicated to transforming complex challenges into scalable and secure solutions.

My approach is deeply technical, constantly exploring the languages and tools that shape the future of software engineering. I am an active curator of the technology landscape, having starred over 2800 repositories and explored more than 6800 unique topics, which reflects an insatiable curiosity and a commitment to staying at the forefront. Additionally, I share my knowledge and insights through my blog, contributing to the community with detailed articles on the technologies that fascinate me most.

While my commit activity in public repositories may be light, my focus is on strategic architecture, curating high-impact projects, and disseminating knowledge. I believe that innovation lies as much in creating code as in the ability to identify, integrate, and optimize the best existing solutions, always with a keen eye on developer experience and operational sustainability.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, I am concentrating my efforts and studies on the following areas, aiming to deepen my expertise and apply best practices in each domain:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing cloud infrastructures for maximum efficiency, scalability, and cost control, ensuring resources are utilized smartly and economically.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating environments and tools that empower developers to be more productive and satisfied, streamlining workflows and reducing friction in the development cycle.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing automated and robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, promoting agility, quality, and speed in software delivery.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security as a fundamental pillar throughout all phases of the software development lifecycle, from design to deployment and operation, proactively mitigating risks.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and managing Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that provide self-service capabilities and standardized tools for engineering teams, accelerating innovation.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying sound software design principles, architectural patterns, and best coding practices to build scalable, resilient, and high-performance applications.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating containerized applications with Kubernetes, exploring its vast range of functionalities for microservices management, scalability, and high availability.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Developing and implementing observability strategies (logs, metrics, traces) and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices to monitor, analyze, and ensure the reliability and performance of distributed systems.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
My recent activity is focused on continuous exploration and curation of projects that drive efficiency and experience in Cloud Native environments. I am actively following and evaluating technologies that complement my expertise in architecture and platform:

*   **GitHub Profile Automation & Metrics**: Exploring tools like `lowlighter/metrics` to automate the generation of infographics and metrics that visually represent a developer's journey, with a focus on GitHub Actions and APIs.
*   **CLI Tools for Infrastructure**: Delving into command-line utilities such as `huseyinbabal/taws` (Rust) for efficiently managing AWS resources via the terminal, and `sainnhe/tmux-fzf` to optimize terminal work environments.
*   **Security & Secret Management in Kubernetes**: Analyzing solutions like `external-secrets/external-secrets` (Go) to integrate external secret managers with Kubernetes, strengthening the security posture in containerized environments.
*   **Productivity Optimization & System Tools**: Evaluating software that enhances productivity on macOS, such as `rxhanson/Rectangle` for window management and `angristan/MacThrottle` for performance monitoring.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
In my journey of continuous learning, I am focusing on the following technologies and concepts, driven by the trends and needs of the Cloud Native landscape:

*   **Rust for System Tools**: Deepening my knowledge in Rust for developing high-performance and secure CLI and system tools, inspired by projects like `taws`.
*   **Go for Orchestration & Automation**: Exploring advanced patterns in Go to build robust Kubernetes operators and automation tools, as seen in `external-secrets` and `witr`.
*   **Advanced FinOps**: Studying strategies and tools to further optimize cloud costs, transforming cloud financial management into a continuous and integrated process.
*   **Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)**: Researching best practices and architectures for building effective IDPs, focusing on how they can accelerate delivery and improve developer experience.
*   **Software Supply Chain Security**: Investigating the latest trends and tools in DevSecOps to ensure the integrity and security of the entire software lifecycle, from dependencies to deployment.
