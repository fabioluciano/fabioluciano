## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer with a passion for transforming complex challenges into efficient and scalable solutions. My professional journey is driven by a constant pursuit of excellence in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, **Software Engineering**, **Kubernetes & Containers**, and **Observability & SRE**.

With extensive experience across various technology domains, I specialize in architecting robust systems and optimizing the software development lifecycle. I am a Go and Rust enthusiast, with deep expertise in container orchestration using Kubernetes and building resilient cloud infrastructures. My curiosity leads me to constantly explore new tools and approaches, always focusing on security, automation, and performance.

I maintain an active portfolio of 44 personal repositories and an impressive collection of over 3000 stars on open-source projects, reflecting my commitment to the community and my appetite for continuous learning. I am a strong advocate for a culture of collaboration and platform engineering as a key to unlocking productivity and innovation.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, I am dedicated to deepening and applying my knowledge in the following strategic areas:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing scalable, resilient, and cost-optimized cloud infrastructures, with a focus on providers like AWS and GCP.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating tools, platforms, and processes that empower developers to deliver value faster and more enjoyably.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery practices to accelerate the software lifecycle and ensure quality.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security into all stages of the development pipeline, from design to operation, with a focus on security as code and system hardening.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that abstract infrastructure complexity and provide self-service tools.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing high-quality, performant, and maintainable software, utilizing robust design principles and architectural patterns.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating containers and managing Kubernetes clusters in production environments, optimizing performance and resilience.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to ensure system health and performance, and applying Site Reliability Engineering principles.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
Even with lighter public commit activity recently, my involvement with the community and tool development remains active through contributions and exploration of new ideas:

*   **[tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A robust framework for `tmux` status bars, boasting 449 stars. It showcases my expertise in shell automation and optimizing developer experience in terminal environments.
*   **[fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A personal Python tool for analyzing GitHub profiles, reflecting my interest in data, automation, and enhancing developer tooling.
*   **Contributing to integr8/integr8.me**: Actively involved in Pull Requests and discussions in external projects, such as `integr8/integr8.me`, demonstrating my commitment to open-source collaboration.
*   **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)**: My personal website, built with Astro, serving as a hub for my projects, publications, and thoughts.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity constantly drives me to explore new technologies and concepts. Recently, my interests have gravitated towards:

*   **Rust for Systems and Tools**: Delving deeper into Rust for asynchronous embedded systems development (`embassy-rs/embassy`) and crafting efficient CLI and TUI tools, as explored in `keifu` and `bichon`.
*   **eBPF and Linux System Programming**: Investigating the use of eBPF for system observability and security in Go (`loresuso/psc`), alongside revisiting Linux system programming in C (`stewartweiss/intro-linux-sys-prog`).
*   **AI Agents for Development**: Exploring the application of artificial intelligence agents and multi-agent orchestration to optimize code workflows, as seen in `1code`, `openwork`, and `oh-my-claudecode`.
*   **DevSecOps and System Hardening**: Focusing on advanced hardening strategies for Linux systems and services like SSH and Nginx, utilizing tools such as `ansible-collection-hardening`.
*   **Cross-Platform Development with Tauri**: Experimenting with Tauri v2 to build native desktop applications with web interfaces, as exemplified by `Handy`.
