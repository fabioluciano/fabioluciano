## 👋 About Me
Hi there! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer passionate about optimizing how we build and deliver software. With a solid background in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, and **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, I'm dedicated to creating robust, efficient, and secure development ecosystems. My professional journey focuses on transforming complex challenges into scalable solutions, always with a keen eye on **Developer Experience (DevEx)**.

I'm a strong advocate for a culture of collaboration and intelligent automation, actively exploring the frontiers of **DevSecOps & Security** to integrate security from the early stages of the software lifecycle. My proficiency in **Software Engineering** allows me to navigate various languages and technologies, with a specialization in **Kubernetes & Containers** for workload orchestration. I believe that **Observability & SRE** are pillars for resilient systems, and I constantly seek to improve visibility and reliability in operations.

My curiosity drives me to explore new technological frontiers, from TUI tools in Rust and Go to the application of eBPF for low-level observability. I actively contribute to the open-source community, as a maintainer of the popular `tmux-powerkit`, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and share knowledge.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my efforts and studies are concentrated on the following areas, aiming to enhance value delivery and technological innovation:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing resilient infrastructures and optimizing costs in cloud environments, with a focus on efficiency and financial governance. Exploring tools like `aws-doctor` for spending analysis.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Building tools and processes that empower developers, making the software development lifecycle more productive and enjoyable.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing end-to-end continuous integration and delivery pipelines, automating workflows, and fostering an automation culture.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices throughout all stages of development and operation, from code analysis to runtime environment protection, with interest in `protection` technologies and secure networks like Reticulum.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing internal platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity, allowing product teams to focus on business logic.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying design and architectural principles to build scalable, performant, and easily maintainable systems, utilizing languages like Go, Rust, and TypeScript.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating large-scale applications, managing clusters, and exploring the advanced capabilities of the Kubernetes ecosystem, including tools like `psc` for container context.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to ensure system health and performance, focusing on resilience and continuous improvement of reliability.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
My passion for building and optimizing is reflected in some personal projects and contributions:

*   **[tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A robust framework for the tmux status bar, focused on customization and productivity. This project demonstrates my expertise in Shell Scripting and command-line tools.
*   **[fabioluciano.com](https://fabioluciano.com)**: My personal website and blog, where I share insights on architecture, DevOps, and Developer Experience, built with MDX.
*   **[resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)**: An example of how I apply engineering principles to automate and manage even my resume, using Typst.
*   **TUI and eBPF Tools Exploration**: Currently, I'm developing small prototypes and exploring tools like `xdgctl`, `keifu`, and `psc` to better understand system interaction and low-level observability.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My learning journey is continuous, with a focus on the following areas and technologies:

*   **eBPF for Observability and Security**: Deepening knowledge in eBPF for low-level system monitoring and anomaly detection, inspired by projects like `psc`.
*   **Artificial Intelligence & Developer Tools**: Exploring how AI can enhance developer productivity and experience, with interest in code models and tools like `humanizer`, `1code`, and `openwork`.
*   **CLI and TUI Tool Development with Rust and Go**: Improving skills in creating command-line interfaces and interactive terminals for automation and visualization, using Rust (`keifu`) and Go.
*   **Cloud Cost Optimization (FinOps)**: Investigating advanced strategies and tools for cost optimization and governance in cloud environments, such as `aws-doctor`.
*   **Cross-Platform Development with Tauri**: Exploring modern frameworks like Tauri to build lightweight and efficient desktop applications from web technologies, as seen in the `Handy` project.
