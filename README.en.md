## 👋 About Me
I'm Fábio Luciano, a Cloud Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer with a passion for optimizing the software development lifecycle and building resilient cloud infrastructures. With over 50 public repositories and extensive technology exploration (more than 3000 starred repositories and 7000 unique topics), my professional journey is driven by a constant pursuit of efficiency, security, and exceptional Developer Experience (DevEx).

My expertise ranges from **Cloud Architecture & FinOps** to implementing **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, encompassing **DevSecOps & Security** and building **Platform Engineering (IDP)**. I am deeply involved with **Kubernetes & Containers**, **Software Engineering**, and **Observability & SRE**, always seeking solutions that simplify developers' lives and ensure system robustness. My contribution to `tmux-powerkit`, with hundreds of stars, is a testament to my commitment to tools that empower productivity.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, I am dedicated to deepening and applying knowledge in the following areas, constantly seeking innovation and improvements:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing scalable infrastructures and optimizing cloud costs, with a focus on AWS and FinOps practices to maximize value and minimize waste.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating environments and tools that make developers' work more productive, enjoyable, and less error-prone, from intuitive CLIs to efficient CI/CD systems.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing continuous delivery and continuous integration pipelines that automate the software lifecycle, ensuring fast, reliable, and secure releases.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices into all phases of development and operations, from static code analysis to protecting production environments.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining internal platforms that offer developers a set of self-service tools and services, accelerating innovation and standardizing infrastructure.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing robust, performant, and high-quality software, using languages like Go, Rust, and Python to build backend solutions and system tools.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating and managing applications in containerized environments with Kubernetes, focusing on scalability, resilience, and automation.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing systems to ensure application health and performance, and applying Site Reliability Engineering principles for high-availability operations.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
While my recent public commit activity is lighter, I dedicate time to maintaining and exploring projects that reflect my interests in Developer Experience, automation, and personal branding.

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: Maintaining and enhancing "The Ultimate tmux Status Bar Framework," a tool that elevates the terminal experience for developers.
*   **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)**: My personal website/blog, where I explore MDX and publish insights on technology and engineering.
*   **[fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)**: A resume automation project using Typst, demonstrating my interest in process engineering and modern tooling.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity leads me to constantly explore new technologies and refine my skills. Based on my recently starred repositories and emerging trends, I am focused on:

*   **Cloud Cost Optimization & Diagnostic Tools**: Exploring tools like `aws-doctor` (Go) to diagnose and optimize AWS spending, deepening my capabilities in FinOps.
*   **Terminal User Interfaces (TUI) & Productivity Tools**: Investigating projects like `xdgctl` (C) and `keifu` (Rust) to create and utilize more efficient and visual command-line tools.
*   **Systems Engineering with Go and Rust**: Deepening the use of Go in observability tools (`psc`) and Rust in system utilities and networking, aiming for performance and security.
*   **AI Integration in Development**: Exploring tools and concepts that integrate artificial intelligence to enhance developer productivity, as demonstrated by stars in `humanizer` and `1code`.
*   **Linux System Programming**: Studying fundamentals and advanced practices of system programming in Linux, as evidenced by interest in `intro-linux-sys-prog` (C).
