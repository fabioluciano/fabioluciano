## 👋 About Me

I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer based in Brasília, Brazil. My professional journey is driven by a passion for building and optimizing development ecosystems that empower teams to deliver value efficiently and securely. With solid experience, I am dedicated to enhancing **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, ensuring solutions are scalable and economically viable.

My expertise spans several critical areas for modern development. I am an enthusiast of **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, always seeking to simplify developers' daily work. I have deep knowledge in **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**, implementing automation and pipelines that accelerate software delivery. Security is a priority, so I integrate **DevSecOps & Security** practices throughout the lifecycle. My role as a **Platform Engineer (IDP)** focuses on building internal tools and platforms that boost productivity. Furthermore, I have a robust background in **Software Engineering**, designing robust systems, and I am a "Kubestronaut," specializing in **Kubernetes & Containers**, mastering workload orchestration. Finally, I ensure system stability and performance through **Observability & SRE**, continuously monitoring and optimizing.

With over 56 public repositories and recent activity focused on contributions and Pull Request reviews, I constantly seek new technologies and patterns to apply and share. My blog is a space where I delve into these topics, transforming challenges into practical insights.
