## 👋 About Me

I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect passionate about building and optimizing technology ecosystems that drive innovation and efficiency. With a solid background in engineering and infrastructure, I am dedicated to simplifying complexities and empowering development teams. My current bio, "Brazilian solutions architect," reflects this passion for creating robust and scalable solutions.

My core expertise lies at the intersection of cloud and the development lifecycle. I specialize in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, designing infrastructures that are not only powerful but also economically viable. I have an intense focus on enhancing **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, creating environments and tools that allow developers to innovate smoothly. I work extensively with **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, implementing end-to-end automation, and I am a tireless advocate for **DevSecOps & Security**, ensuring that security is a pillar, not an afterthought.

Furthermore, my passion extends to **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, where I build internal platforms that empower teams, and **Software Engineering**, developing resilient and scalable systems. I possess in-depth knowledge of **Kubernetes & Containers**, orchestrating applications at scale, and I am committed to **Observability & SRE**, ensuring continuous system health and performance. I believe that automation is key to unlocking human potential for more strategic challenges, a philosophy I apply to both personal projects and open-source contributions, such as my `tmux-powerkit` and contributions to `integr8/integr8.me`.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests

Currently, my focus and passion revolve around the following areas, always seeking to deepen my knowledge and apply best practices:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing cloud infrastructures (primarily AWS, Azure, GCP) for maximum scalability, resilience, and cost-effectiveness, ensuring cloud investments generate the highest possible value.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating environments, tools, and processes that make development more productive, intuitive, and enjoyable, reducing friction and increasing engineer satisfaction.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) practices and pipelines that automate and accelerate the software development lifecycle, from commit to production.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security as an intrinsic component at all stages of development, from design and coding to deployment and operation, protecting applications and infrastructure.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) that abstract infrastructure complexity, empowering engineering teams to focus on business logic.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Building robust, scalable, and high-performance systems, with a focus on distributed architectures, microservices, and design patterns that ensure maintainability and extensibility.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating containerized applications and managing Kubernetes clusters for complex production environments, exploring the latest trends in state management and extensibility.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting solutions to ensure the continuous reliability, performance, and health of systems in production, applying Site Reliability Engineering principles.

## 🚀 Projects in Development

While my recent public repository activity has been more focused on review and exploration, I maintain several active personal projects and am always investigating new tools and concepts:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: My `tmux` status bar framework, which continues to be a passion project and one of my most popular repositories (⭐ 433).
*   **[integr8/integr8.me](https://github.com/integr8/integr8.me)**: I have been actively contributing Pull Requests to this external TypeScript project, focused on integration and automation.
*   **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)** & **[fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)**: My personal website and resume projects, demonstrating my interest in modern web development tools (Astro) and document automation (Typst).
*   **[fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A Python project that reflects my interest in data analysis and profile automation, just like this README!

## 🌱 Currently Learning

I am constantly exploring new technologies and deepening my knowledge in emerging areas, as evidenced by my recent starred repositories. Currently, I am focused on:

*   🦀 **Rust for Command-Line Tools**: Exploring the use of Rust to create efficient and high-performance terminal tools, as seen in projects like `huseyinbabal/taws` (Terminal UI for AWS).
*   🔒 **Advanced Kubernetes Secrets Management**: Delving into solutions like `external-secrets` (Go) to securely orchestrate and inject secrets into Kubernetes environments.
*   💡 **Browser Automation & AI**: Investigating Go frameworks like `VibiumDev/vibium` for browser automation, with a focus on AI agents and advanced workflows.
*   💰 **FinOps & Cloud Cost Optimization**: Analyzing tools and approaches to classify and optimize financial transactions in cloud environments, such as the `davidfowl/tally` (Python) project.
*   🖥️ **Terminal Productivity with `tmux` and `fzf`**: Enhancing my development environment with advanced `tmux` and `fzf` plugins and configurations, inspired by `sainnhe/tmux-fzf`.
