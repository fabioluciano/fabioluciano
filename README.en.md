👋 About Me

Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect passionate about transforming complex challenges into robust and scalable engineering solutions. My professional journey has led me to delve deep into various crucial areas for the development and operation of modern systems. I specialize in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, ensuring that solutions not only function but do so efficiently and cost-effectively.

I am dedicated to enhancing **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, creating environments and tools that empower developers to be more productive and satisfied. I am an enthusiast of **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**, implementing automated pipelines that accelerate delivery and ensure software quality. Security is a top priority, which is why I work with **DevSecOps & Security**, integrating security practices throughout the entire development lifecycle. My experience in **Platform Engineering (IDP)** allows me to build the foundations upon which engineering teams can thrive, with a focus on high-quality **Software Engineering**. I possess deep knowledge in **Kubernetes & Containers**, orchestrating applications in distributed environments, and I am a proponent of **Observability & SRE**, ensuring systems are monitored and resilient. With 44 personal repositories and over 3000 stars given, I demonstrate insatiable curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning and contributing to the open-source community, as evidenced by my popular `tmux-powerkit` project.
