## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer with a deep passion for building robust, scalable, and efficient systems. My professional journey is focused on transforming complex infrastructure and development challenges into elegant, automated solutions. I have consolidated expertise in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, always seeking cost and performance optimization, and I am a strong advocate for **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, creating environments that empower developers.

With a holistic view, I operate at the forefront of **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, implementing practices that ensure fast and secure deliveries. Security is paramount, and therefore, I dedicate myself to integrating **DevSecOps & Security** throughout the entire software lifecycle. My experience in **Platform Engineering (IDP)** allows me to design and implement internal developer platforms that accelerate innovation. I am also a Software Engineer who loves diving into **Kubernetes & Containers**, orchestrating complex applications, and I am a firm believer in **Observability & SRE** to ensure the continuous reliability and performance of systems. I actively contribute to the open-source community, as evidenced by my popular `tmux-powerkit` project, focused on enhancing the terminal developer experience.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
My curiosity and experience drive me to explore and deepen my knowledge in the following areas:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing scalable and resilient infrastructures in cloud environments, with a focus on intelligent cost and resource management.
