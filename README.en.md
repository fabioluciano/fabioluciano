## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests

My professional journey and technological passions are centered on several crucial areas for modern software development and operations:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing cloud infrastructure solutions for scalability, resilience, and cost efficiency, with a focus on cloud financial management.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Crafting environments and tools that elevate developer satisfaction, productivity, and workflow, reducing friction and bottlenecks.
*   🔄 **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**: Implementing automated and efficient Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, fostering a culture of collaboration and agility.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices into all phases of the development lifecycle, from design to operation, to build inherently secure systems.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) that provide self-service tools and services for engineering teams.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Designing and implementing high-quality, maintainable, and performant software, with a focus on clean code principles and robust architectures.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating containerized applications at scale, ensuring high availability, scalability, and efficient resource management.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing robust monitoring, logging, and tracing systems to ensure application reliability, performance, and resilience, following Site Reliability Engineering principles.

## 🚀 Projects in Development

While my recent public activity might be light in commits, my active projects reflect my passions for developer tooling, infrastructure, and knowledge sharing:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A robust framework for `tmux` status bars, focused on terminal customization and productivity. (Shell)
*   **[fabioluciano/kubestronaut](https://github.com/fabioluciano/kubestronaut)**: A comprehensive guide to mastering Kubernetes and preparing for certifications like KCNA, CKA, and others. A valuable resource for those looking to delve into container orchestration.
*   **[fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A Python tool for analyzing GitHub profiles, demonstrating an interest in automation, data analysis, and developer tooling.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

My learning journey is continuous, exploring new technologies and deepening my understanding of areas that drive innovation and efficiency. My recent GitHub stars indicate a growing focus on:

*   **Universal Artifact Registries**: Exploring solutions like `artifact-keeper` (Rust, TypeScript) for efficient and secure software artifact management, aligning with DevOps and security practices.
*   **Developer Tools & Productivity**: Delving into tools that enhance the coding experience and efficiency, such as `maple-font` (programming fonts) and `git-cola` (Git GUI).
*   **Kubernetes Observability**: Investigating new approaches for visualizing and troubleshooting logs in Kubernetes environments, such as `khi` (Go), reinforcing my SRE focus.
*   **Automation & AI**: Exploring AI agents and personal assistants (`openclaw` in TypeScript) for task automation and workflow optimization.
*   **Typst Drawing & Typography**: Exploring `cetz` for programmatic drawing and `typst` as a modern tool for document composition, showing interest in new productivity tools and technical documentation.
