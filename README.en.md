## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer with a deep passion for building and optimizing robust, scalable development ecosystems. My professional journey is driven by a continuous pursuit of efficiency, security, and an exceptional developer experience. I believe that technology should empower, and I am dedicated to creating environments where innovation thrives with less friction and more confidence.

My expertise spans a broad and critical spectrum of modern development, including **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, **Software Engineering**, **Kubernetes & Containers**, and **Observability & SRE**. I have a particular focus on Kubernetes and container orchestration, as well as building platforms that simplify infrastructure complexity for engineering teams.

With over 50 public repositories and a history of starring over 3000 projects, my profile reflects an insatiable curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning. I am an active open-source contributor and an enthusiast for sharing knowledge, always seeking new ways to automate, optimize, and innovate.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, I am focused on deepening and applying my knowledge in the following areas, seeking solutions that drive productivity and resilience:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing scalable, resilient, and secure cloud infrastructures, with a strong emphasis on cost optimization and financial governance (FinOps).
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating tools, processes, and platforms that make developers' lives easier, more productive, and more enjoyable, from local development to production deployment.
*   🔄 **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**: Implementing automated and efficient Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that ensure fast, reliable, and high-quality deliveries.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices into all phases of the software development lifecycle, ensuring that security is a core pillar, not an afterthought.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) that provide self-service capabilities and abstract infrastructure complexity.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Designing and implementing robust, scalable, and high-performance software systems, with a focus on modern architectures and efficient design patterns.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating large-scale applications using Kubernetes, Docker, and other containerization technologies, managing clusters, and developing operators.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to ensure full visibility into systems and applying Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles to maintain stability and performance.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
My recent activity, though focused on Pull Requests and exploration, reflects a continuous commitment to improving tools and infrastructures:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: Maintaining and enhancing this ultimate framework for the `tmux` status bar, which continues to be a popular tool for terminal productivity.
*   **Contributing to [integr8/integr8.me](https://github.com/integr8/integr8.me)**: Actively involved in the open-source community, contributing Pull Requests to this project, demonstrating my interest in collaboration and innovative solutions.
*   **[fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)** and **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)**: Exploring the automation and modernization of professional profiles and personal websites using technologies like Typst and Astro, reflecting an interest in tooling and process automation.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity leads me to constantly explore new technologies and delve deeper into emerging areas, as evidenced by my recent starred repositories:

*   **Rust for System Tools**: Deepening my knowledge in Rust for developing high-performance command-line tools and low-level systems, such as `taws` (Terminal UI for AWS).
*   **GitHub Profile Automation & Metrics**: Exploring tools like `lowlighter/metrics` to build and optimize GitHub profile automation and metrics for better visibility and insights.
*   **Go for Kubernetes Operators & Infrastructure Tools**: Continuing to enhance my skills in Go, especially for developing Kubernetes operators and infrastructure management tools, as seen in `external-secrets` and `witr`.
*   **Terminal Productivity Tools (TUI/CLI)**: Focused on improving the experience with Terminal User Interfaces (TUI) and Command-Line Interface (CLI) tools for cloud management and workflow optimization, with examples like `tmux-fzf`.
*   **Secrets Management in Kubernetes**: Exploring advanced solutions for managing and orchestrating secrets in Kubernetes environments, ensuring security and compliance.
