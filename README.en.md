## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect with a passion for building robust systems and optimizing the developer experience. My professional journey focuses on transforming complex infrastructure and software engineering challenges into efficient and scalable solutions. With extensive expertise in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, and **Platform Engineering**, I constantly strive to improve how teams deliver value.

I am a strong advocate for **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, believing that developer productivity and satisfaction are cornerstones for the success of any product. My expertise extends to **Kubernetes & Containers**, **DevSecOps & Security**, **Software Engineering**, and **Observability & SRE**, ensuring that solutions are not only performant but also secure and easy to operate. I love exploring new technologies, as evidenced by my extensive list of starred projects and tools, continuously seeking best practices and innovations.

My contributions to the open-source community include projects like `tmux-powerkit`, a popular framework for the tmux status bar, and `kubestronaut`, a comprehensive guide to mastering Kubernetes. Through my blog, I share insights on DevEx, productivity, and the complexities of software engineering, reinforcing my commitment to elevating the industry standard.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my efforts and studies are concentrated on the following areas, where I aim to apply and expand my knowledge:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing resilient and scalable cloud infrastructures, with a focus on cost optimization and financial governance in environments like AWS and Google Cloud.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Developing and implementing strategies to improve developer workflows, reducing friction and boosting productivity and satisfaction.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Automating and optimizing continuous integration and delivery pipelines to ensure fast, secure, and reliable software releases.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices from the very beginning of the development cycle, ensuring applications and infrastructures are secure by design.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms that offer self-service capabilities and standardized tools for development teams.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying design principles, architectural patterns, and best coding practices to create high-quality, maintainable, and scalable software.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Mastering container orchestration and managing distributed applications at scale, including exploring advanced monitoring and troubleshooting tools.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to ensure full system visibility and operational reliability of production services.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
While my recent public commit activity has been light, I am constantly exploring and contributing to projects that reflect my passions and expertise. My active repositories are a testament to my commitment to the community and continuous improvement:

*   [**fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit**](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit): A robust framework for the `tmux` status bar, widely used and focused on customization and performance.
*   [**fabioluciano/kubestronaut**](https://github.com/fabioluciano/kubestronaut): A comprehensive guide for those looking to master Kubernetes and prepare for certifications like KCNA and CKA, demonstrating my deep knowledge in container orchestration.
*   [**fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer**](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer): A personal Python tool to analyze GitHub profiles, highlighting my interest in automation and data analysis within the development context.
*   Actively exploring the ecosystem of platform engineering tools and container security solutions, as reflected in my recent starred repositories.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technologies and trends. I am currently deepening my knowledge in:

*   **AI Agents & LLMs (Large Language Models)**: Investigating frameworks and tools like `claude-code`, `openclaw`, and `Maestro` for orchestrating intelligent agents and automating development tasks.
*   **Rust Development**: Exploring Rust's potential for system-level tools, artifact registries (`artifact-keeper`), and creative coding (`nannou`), given its performance and safety features.
*   **Advanced Kubernetes & Observability Tools**: Delving into solutions like `khi` for visualizing and troubleshooting logs in Kubernetes clusters, and refining SRE strategies.
*   **Container Security & DevSecOps**: Analyzing CVE-hardened container images (`minimal`) and integrating security practices into CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Developer Tooling & Productivity**: Evaluating VS Code extensions (`vscode-codeimg`) and Git GUIs (`git-cola`) to optimize the development workflow.
