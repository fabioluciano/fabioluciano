## 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect with a deep passion for transforming how engineering teams work. With 54 public repositories and a growing community of 137 followers, my focus is on building robust and scalable systems while elevating the Developer Experience (DevEx) to new heights. I believe that engineer efficiency and satisfaction are as crucial as the technical architecture itself.

My expertise spans several key areas of modern engineering: from cost optimization and infrastructure design with **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, through ensuring system reliability with **Observability & SRE**, to building agile and secure development environments with **DevOps & Modern CI/CD** and **DevSecOps & Security**. I am an enthusiast of **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, focused on empowering teams through well-designed tools and infrastructure.

With in-depth knowledge of **Software Engineering** and the orchestration of applications in **Kubernetes & Containers**, I am always seeking innovative solutions that balance performance, security, and usability. My open-source projects, such as the popular `tmux-powerkit` and the `kubestronaut` guide, reflect my commitment to sharing knowledge and contributing to the community.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests

Currently, my energy is concentrated on:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing cloud infrastructures for maximum efficiency, scalability, and cost control.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating environments and tools that make the development lifecycle smoother, more productive, and enjoyable for engineers.
*   🔄 **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**: Implementing cutting-edge continuous integration and delivery pipelines, automating processes, and fostering a culture of collaboration.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices from the beginning of the development cycle, ensuring applications are robust and resilient to threats.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing and maintaining internal platforms that serve as the backbone for innovation and productivity for engineering teams.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying design and architectural principles to build complex, efficient, and high-quality systems.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Mastering container orchestration to effectively deploy, scale, and manage applications in distributed environments.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring solutions and Site Reliability Engineering practices to ensure system availability, performance, and reliability.

## 🚀 Projects in Development

While my recent public commit activity has been light, I am actively involved in the evolution and maintenance of impactful projects:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A robust framework for the tmux status bar, with 463 stars, reflecting my interest in command-line tools and developer experience customization.
*   **[fabioluciano/kubestronaut](https://github.com/fabioluciano/kubestronaut)**: A comprehensive guide to mastering Kubernetes and the KCNA, CKA certifications, a valuable resource for the container orchestration community.
*   **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)**: The repository for my personal blog, where I share insights on DevEx, cloud architecture, and software engineering, using MDX for dynamic content.
*   **[fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A Python tool I developed to analyze GitHub profiles, demonstrating my interest in automation and data analysis for profile optimization.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

I am constantly exploring new technologies and concepts to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge, with a particular focus on:

*   **AI Agents & Orchestration**: Diving deeper into frameworks and tools for artificial intelligence agents, such as those seen in `Maestro`, `pi-mono`, and `openclaw`, with a focus on `claude-code` and `codex` for workflow optimization.
*   **Creative Development with Rust**: Exploring `nannou-org/nannou` to understand Rust's possibilities in creative coding, combining performance with artistic expression.
*   **Self-Hosted Solutions**: Investigating projects like `puemos/craftplan` (D2C micro-business management) and `jeffvli/feishin` (self-hosted music player) to better understand autonomy and control over data and services.
*   **Kubernetes Observability & Troubleshooting**: Studying tools like `GoogleCloudPlatform/khi` to enhance log visualization and troubleshooting capabilities in complex Kubernetes environments.
*   **Rust for Platform Tools**: With Rust's growing popularity in infrastructure tools, I am dedicating time to improve my skills in this language, which ranks among my top languages.
