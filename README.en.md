## 👋 About Me
I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer with a deep passion for transforming how teams develop and deliver software. My professional journey is marked by a continuous pursuit of efficiency, scalability, and security, always with a focus on optimizing the Developer Experience (DevEx).

Throughout my career, I've delved into areas like **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, and **Kubernetes & Containers**, building robust and strategic solutions. I have a strong commitment to high-quality **Software Engineering**, integrating security through **DevSecOps**, and ensuring system reliability with **Observability & SRE**. With over 50 public repositories and an extensive collection of starred projects, my profile reflects a continuous journey of exploration and contribution in the tech universe.

I am also an Open Source enthusiast and creator of projects like `tmux-powerkit` and `kubestronaut`, in addition to sharing insights on productivity and developer experience on my blog. My curiosity drives me to explore new technological frontiers, ensuring that my solutions are not only effective but also innovative and future-proof.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my work and studies are concentrated on the following areas, aiming to deepen knowledge and apply best practices in each domain:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing scalable, resilient, and, crucially, cost-optimized cloud infrastructures.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating environments and tools that empower developers, simplifying workflows and accelerating the feedback loop.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines that automate and streamline software deployment with security.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices from the early stages of development, ensuring security is a pillar, not an afterthought.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing and maintaining internal platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity, allowing product teams to focus on innovation.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Focusing on building robust, performant, and maintainable systems, applying solid design and architecture principles.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Mastering container orchestration to build and manage highly available and scalable distributed applications.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to gain deep insights into system behavior and ensure operational reliability.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
My passion for technology is reflected in the maintenance and creation of projects that aim to solve practical challenges and disseminate knowledge.

*   **[tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A robust framework for the tmux status bar, designed to maximize terminal productivity. With nearly 500 stars, it demonstrates my focus on tools for Developer Experience.
*   **[kubestronaut](https://github.com/fabioluciano/kubestronaut)**: A comprehensive guide to mastering Kubernetes, from KCNA to CKA. This project reflects my commitment to sharing knowledge and empowering the community in container orchestration technologies.
*   **[fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)**: The repository for my personal website and blog, where I explore topics such as Developer Experience, DevOps, and software architecture, using MDX for content creation.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
Curiosity is a constant driver in my journey, and I am always exploring new technologies and paradigms. Currently, my interests and studies include:

*   🤖 **Artificial Intelligence & Agent Toolkits**: Diving into LLMs and frameworks for creating AI agents, exploring how they can optimize development workflows (evidenced by stars on `openclaw`, `pi-mono`, and topics like `claude-code`).
*   🦀 **Rust Ecosystem for Infrastructure & Platform**: Deepening the use of Rust for DevOps tools, artifact systems, and security, driven by projects like `artifact-keeper`.
*   🔍 **Advanced Observability & Kubernetes Troubleshooting**: Exploring new tools for log visualization and problem diagnosis in Kubernetes environments, such as Google Cloud's `khi`.
*   🛠️ **Productivity Tools & Code Experience Enhancements**: Investigating VSCode extensions and utilities that improve code creation and visualization, such as `vscode-codeimg` and `beautiful-mermaid`.
