## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer passionate about optimizing the developer experience and building robust, scalable cloud-native systems. Based in Brasília, Brazil, my work revolves around bridging the gap between complex infrastructure and seamless development workflows, ensuring teams can innovate faster and more efficiently.

My expertise spans a broad spectrum of modern software development and operations. I'm deeply involved in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, constantly seeking cost-effective and resilient solutions. **Developer Experience (DevEx)** is a core philosophy for me, as evidenced by my recent articles exploring how to reduce friction and boost productivity. I champion **DevOps & Modern CI/CD** practices, integrating **DevSecOps & Security** from design to deployment. My focus on **Platform Engineering (IDP)** aims to empower development teams with self-service capabilities, while a solid foundation in **Software Engineering** ensures quality and scalability. I have a strong command of **Kubernetes & Containers** for orchestrating complex environments and prioritize **Observability & SRE** to maintain system health and reliability.

With a history of contributing to open-source projects like `tmux-powerkit` and authoring comprehensive guides like `kubestronaut`, I'm an avid learner and knowledge sharer. My extensive starred repositories and diverse topic exploration reflect a continuous curiosity for new technologies and best practices, always with an eye towards practical application and community engagement.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
My current efforts and explorations are concentrated on the following key areas, where I strive to implement best practices and drive innovation:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing highly available, scalable, and cost-optimized cloud solutions, primarily leveraging AWS and GCP services, with a strong emphasis on financial governance.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Crafting intuitive tools, streamlined processes, and supportive environments that enhance developer productivity, satisfaction, and flow state.
*   🔄 **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**: Implementing sophisticated automation pipelines and fostering a culture of continuous integration and delivery to accelerate software release cycles and reduce lead time.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices and tooling throughout the entire software development lifecycle, from code inception to production operation, ensuring robust protection.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining internal developer platforms (IDPs) that provide self-service capabilities and standardized tooling, enabling teams to focus on business logic.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing high-quality, performant, and maintainable software applications, adhering to design patterns, architectural principles, and clean code methodologies.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating containerized workloads and managing cloud-native infrastructure, focusing on high availability, resilience, and efficient resource utilization.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting systems to gain deep insights into application behavior and ensure the reliability and performance of production systems.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
I'm actively involved in maintaining and developing projects that reflect my technical interests and contributions to the developer community:

*   [**fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit**](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit): A highly popular and customizable framework for creating powerful `tmux` status bars, showcasing my expertise in shell scripting and developer tooling. (⭐ 465, 🍴 75)
*   [**fabioluciano/kubestronaut**](https://github.com/fabioluciano/kubestronaut): A comprehensive guide aimed at helping individuals master Kubernetes and achieve certifications like KCNA, CKA, and more. This project highlights my deep knowledge in container orchestration and commitment to education. (⭐ 46, 🍴 9)
*   [**fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer**](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer): A Python-based tool for analyzing GitHub profiles, demonstrating my interest in data analysis, automation, and creating developer utility tools.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My journey of continuous learning is fueled by exploring cutting-edge technologies and emerging trends, often reflected in my recent engagements:

*   **Universal Artifact Registries & Supply Chain Security**: Exploring solutions like `artifact-keeper` (Rust) for managing diverse software artifacts and enhancing supply chain security.
*   **AI Agent Toolkits & Assistants**: Diving into frameworks such as `openclaw` and `pi-mono` (TypeScript) to understand and build intelligent automation and personal AI assistants, aligning with emerging AI trends like `claude-code`.
*   **Advanced Kubernetes Observability**: Investigating tools like `khi` (Go) for enhanced log viewing and troubleshooting in Kubernetes environments, deepening my expertise in SRE practices.
*   **Creative Coding & Documentation with Typst**: Experimenting with `cetz` (Typst) to explore new paradigms for technical documentation and visual communication.
