## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer with a strong passion for optimizing Developer Experience (DevEx). With extensive experience in systems architecture, software engineering, and operations, I am dedicated to building robust, scalable, and, above all, developer-empowering technology ecosystems. My approach deeply integrates **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, **Software Engineering**, **Kubernetes & Containers**, and **Observability & SRE** to create cutting-edge solutions.

I am a continuous learner and technology explorer, with over 3000 starred repositories and thousands of unique topics investigated. My curiosity drives me to delve into various languages and tools, always seeking to improve how we build and deliver software. I am the maintainer of projects like `tmux-powerkit`, a testament to my commitment to creating tools that make developers' lives easier.

My vision on productivity and developer experience is also reflected in my writings, where I address topics such as DORA, SPACE, and the true meaning of Developer Experience. I believe that before measuring, we need to understand what we value, and it is this philosophy that I apply in building platforms and solutions that truly make a difference.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
My current work and research are focused on:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and implementing resilient, scalable, and cost-efficient cloud infrastructures, with a focus on cost optimization and governance in environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating environments and tools that make the development lifecycle smoother, more productive, and enjoyable, through automation, documentation, and rapid feedback.
*   🔄 **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**: Implementing end-to-end continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices, automating workflows, and ensuring agility and quality in software delivery.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security as an intrinsic part of the entire development and operations cycle, from design to production, with automated tools and processes.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) that offer self-service tools, abstracting infrastructure complexity and accelerating value delivery.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing high-quality software, with a focus on system design, architectural patterns, refactoring, and performance optimization, using languages like Go, Rust, and Python.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating and managing containerized applications at scale, using Kubernetes for deployment automation, scalability, and microservices management.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing robust monitoring systems and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices to ensure the health, performance, and reliability of applications in production.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
I am actively involved in and exploring the following projects and initiatives:

*   **fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit**: A robust framework for the tmux status bar, focused on customization and productivity. This project reflects my interest in developer tooling and terminal workflow optimization.
*   **fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com**: My resume, built with Typst, demonstrating an interest in document automation and modern text engineering tools.
*   **fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer**: A Python tool for analyzing GitHub profiles, illustrating my focus on data and automation for development insights.
*   **Contributing to integr8/integr8.me**: Actively collaborating on external open-source projects, participating in discussions and submitting Pull Requests.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My journey of continuous learning leads me to explore the following areas and technologies:

*   **Advanced TUI/CLI**: Delving into Text User Interface (TUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI) tools with Rust and Go, such as `keifu` (git genealogy TUI) and `xdgctl` (XDG app management).
*   **eBPF for observability and performance**: Investigating the use of eBPF for system diagnostics and cloud cost optimization, as seen in `psc` (ps utility with eBPF) and `aws-doctor` (AWS cost diagnosis).
*   **Self-hosted audio and music ecosystem**: Exploring modern `music-player`s like `feishin` (TypeScript) and `euphonica` (Rust), showing an interest in desktop applications and multimedia.
*   **AI tools for code productivity**: Evaluating the impact and use of tools like `humanizer` and `1code` to optimize code creation and review with AI assistants.
*   **Mesh networks and communication technologies**: Exploring projects like `Reticulum` in Python, which address decentralized networks and resilient communication.
