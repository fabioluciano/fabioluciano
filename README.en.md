## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect passionate about designing and implementing resilient, high-performance systems. With solid experience in transforming complex challenges into scalable solutions, my work focuses on optimizing how teams develop and operate software.

My expertise spans **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, **Software Engineering**, **Kubernetes & Containers**, and **Observability & SRE**. I believe that technical excellence, combined with efficient processes and a collaborative culture, is key to success in modern software engineering environments.

I am a perpetual learner, with over 3000 starred repositories and thousands of topics explored, always seeking the best tools and practices. Based in Brasília, Brazil, I am dedicated to building and improving the infrastructure that empowers developers and drives innovation.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my main areas of interest and activity include:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing cloud infrastructures with a focus on scalability, resilience, and cost control, ensuring financial efficiency and governance.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Enhancing the developer journey through tools, automation, and processes that make work more productive, enjoyable, and less error-prone.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing continuous delivery practices and pipelines to accelerate the development cycle, automate testing and deployments, and ensure software quality.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security into all stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from design to operation, to proactively protect applications and infrastructures.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining internal developer platforms that empower teams to deliver value faster and with autonomy, abstracting infrastructure complexity.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing high-quality software, applying design principles, patterns, and best practices for distributed systems and microservices.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating workloads in containerized environments, exploring advanced Kubernetes capabilities for resilience, automation, and scalability.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Ensuring system reliability and performance through proactive monitoring, logging, and tracing, applying Site Reliability Engineering principles for robust operations.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
While my public commit activity is light, I am constantly involved in projects that reflect my focus on Developer Experience, automation, and productivity tools:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A comprehensive framework for the tmux status bar, showcasing my interest in command-line tools and optimizing the development environment (Shell).
*   **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)**: My personal website, built with Astro, serving as a platform to share knowledge and experiences.
*   **[fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)**: A resume automation project using Typst, a practical example of how I apply engineering principles to optimize repetitive tasks.
*   **[integr8/integr8.me](https://github.com/integr8/integr8.me)**: Contributing to this external project, which aligns with my interest in platforms and tool integration (MDX).

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity drives me to explore new technologies and deepen my knowledge in promising areas. Currently, I am focused on:

*   🦀 **Embedded Rust**: Exploring the `embassy-rs/embassy` framework for modern, asynchronous embedded systems development in Rust, including drivers and HALs.
*   ⚙️ **Declarative Configuration with Jsonnet**: Delving into `google/jsonnet` as a data templating language to manage complex configurations programmatically and functionally.
*   🔄 **Update Automation with Updatecli**: Investigating `updatecli/updatecli` to create declarative update policies, essential for GitOps practices and continuous dependency management.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes Optimization with Descheduler**: Studying `kubernetes-sigs/descheduler` to understand and implement advanced descheduling strategies and resource optimization in Kubernetes clusters.
*   📦 **OCI-Native Registries with Zot**: Exploring `project-zot/zot`, an OCI-native container image registry, to understand best practices in artifact distribution and management.
