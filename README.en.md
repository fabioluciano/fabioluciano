## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer passionate about building and optimizing robust and efficient development ecosystems. My professional journey is driven by a continuous pursuit of innovation and transforming complexity into simplified solutions, always with a keen eye on **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, and **Platform Engineering (IDP)**.

With a solid background in **Software Engineering**, I am dedicated to implementing best practices in **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, ensuring fast and reliable deliveries. I am an enthusiast of **Kubernetes & Containers**, actively exploring the latest orchestration trends to create scalable systems. Furthermore, security and resilience are pillars of my work, applying **DevSecOps & Security** and **Observability & SRE** principles to ensure applications are not only performant but also secure and available.

As a maintainer of open-source projects, such as the acclaimed `tmux-powerkit`, I actively strive to contribute to the community and create tools that enhance developer productivity. My curiosity leads me to constantly explore new technologies and approaches, sharing insights and learnings on my personal blog.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
My passion for optimizing and innovating is reflected in the areas I currently explore and delve into:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing scalable and efficient cloud infrastructures, focusing on cost optimization and financial governance to maximize the value of cloud investments.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating environments, tools, and processes that empower developers, reducing friction, automating repetitive tasks, and increasing productivity and satisfaction.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing automated continuous delivery pipelines and fostering a DevOps culture that accelerates the software development lifecycle, ensuring quality and agility.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices from the earliest stages of development (shift-left) through to operations, ensuring robust, compliant, and threat-resilient systems.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and evolving internal developer platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity, offering self-service capabilities and standardization for engineering teams.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing robust, elegant, and scalable solutions, applying design principles, architectural patterns, and best practices for sustainable, high-quality code.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating and managing containerized applications at scale, exploring the latest trends and tools in the ecosystem to optimize deployment and operations.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing proactive monitoring systems, distributed tracing, and centralized logging, and applying Site Reliability Engineering practices to ensure high availability, performance, and reliability of services.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
Exploring and contributing to projects that reflect my focus on developer tooling, automation, and optimization:

*   **fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit**: The Ultimate tmux Status Bar Framework (Shell). An open-source project with over 450 stars that reflects my passion for command-line tools and customizing the development environment.
*   **fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com**: My personal website and blog, built with MDX, where I share insights on technology, platform engineering, and Developer Experience.
*   **fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer**: A Python project that explores data analysis and automation to extract and visualize metrics from GitHub profiles, demonstrating an interest in meta-engineering and observability of development processes.
*   **integr8/integr8.me**: Actively contributing to this external project, focusing on Pull Requests for improvements and new features, reinforcing my engagement with the open-source community.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity leads me to constantly explore new technologies and approaches, with a current focus on:

*   **Rust for System Tools and TUI**: Deepening my knowledge of Rust to develop high-performance and secure command-line tools and Text User Interfaces (TUI), inspired by projects like `euphonica` and `keifu`.
*   **AWS Cost Optimization with Go**: Exploring Go to build robust and efficient solutions for AWS cost diagnosis and optimization, drawing inspiration from tools like `aws-doctor`.
*   **Artificial Intelligence for Code Productivity**: Investigating how AI can enhance the development experience, from code generation to review and "humanization," with a focus on tools like `humanizer` and `1code`.
*   **Decentralized Mesh Networks with Python**: Learning about the architecture and implementation of cryptographic-based, fault-tolerant mesh networks using Python, through projects like `Reticulum`.
