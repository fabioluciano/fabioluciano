## 👋 About Me
I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer passionate about building scalable, resilient, and efficient systems in the cloud. With extensive experience in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, and **Kubernetes & Containers**, I am dedicated to transforming complexity into simplified solutions that drive innovation and optimize costs. My professional journey is marked by a continuous pursuit of excellence in **Software Engineering** and the creation of environments that empower teams.

I firmly believe that **Developer Experience (DevEx)** and **Platform Engineering (IDP)** are crucial for the success of any modern organization. I work to integrate **DevSecOps & Security** practices from design to operation, ensuring that security is a fundamental pillar. Furthermore, **Observability & SRE** are essential for maintaining system health and ensuring reliability. I am an Open Source enthusiast, actively contributing and developing tools that enhance developer workflows, such as `tmux-powerkit`.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
