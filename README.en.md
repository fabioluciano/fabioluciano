# Fábio Luciano
Solutions Architect focused on Platform Engineering, DevOps, and Developer Experience.

<br>

## 👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect passionate about building robust, scalable, and secure systems, based in Brasília, Brazil. My professional journey is driven by a continuous pursuit of excellence in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, where I optimize infrastructures for performance and cost, and in **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, where I create environments that empower developers.

With extensive experience spanning **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, and **Observability & SRE**, I am dedicated to transforming how engineering teams operate, ensuring efficient workflows and a culture of continuous improvement. I am a relentless advocate for **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, believing that an optimized development environment is key to productivity and innovation. My expertise in **Software Engineering** allows me to delve deep into technical challenges, especially in the realm of **Kubernetes & Containers**, where I design and implement complex solutions. I am a polyglot enthusiast, with a deep affinity for Go, Rust, Python, and TypeScript, and an active maintainer of open-source projects like the popular `tmux-powerkit`, demonstrating my commitment to the community and tools that enhance productivity.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
My passion lies in exploring the frontiers of engineering, with a keen eye on the following areas:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing cloud infrastructures (especially AWS), with a strong emphasis on cost management and operational efficiency. Exploring tools like `aws-doctor` to identify and mitigate waste.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating tools, platforms, and processes that make developers' lives easier, more productive, and enjoyable, such as my `tmux-powerkit` project and contributions to `integr8.me`.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing continuous delivery pipelines and DevOps practices that accelerate the development cycle and ensure software quality.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security into all stages of the software development lifecycle, from conception to operation, with a focus on protection and resilience.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building internal developer platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity, allowing teams to focus on delivering value.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing high-quality software solutions, focusing on robust design, performance, and maintainability, using languages like Go, Rust, and Python.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating large-scale applications with Kubernetes, Docker, and other container technologies, ensuring scalability and resilience.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing systems to ensure application health and performance, with an interest in tools like eBPF for deep insights.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
Even with lighter recent public activity, my focus has been on enhancing existing tools and exploring new ideas:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)** [Shell]: A robust framework for the tmux status bar, boasting over 450 stars. Continuously improving the terminal experience for developers.
*   **[fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)** [Python]: A personal project reflecting my interest in meta-development and automation to optimize digital presence.
*   **[fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)** [Typst]: Demonstrating an engineering approach to personal tasks by automating my resume generation.
*   **[integr8/integr8.me](https://github.com/integr8/integr8.me)**: Contributing to external projects, focusing on improvements and collaboration within the open-source community.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technologies and concepts:

*   **Artificial Intelligence & LLMs**: Closely following innovations in AI, especially in developing tools to optimize code workflows, as shown by stars on `humanizer`, `1code`, and `openwork`.
*   **eBPF for Advanced Observability**: Diving into tools like `psc` to understand process and container behavior at the kernel level, enhancing SRE and debugging capabilities.
*   **TUI Development with Rust**: Exploring the Rust ecosystem to build efficient and powerful terminal user interfaces, as seen in stars on `keifu` and `xdgctl`.
*   **Modern Desktop Application Development**: Interested in frameworks like Tauri and languages like Swift, exploring the creation of cross-platform and native macOS applications, such as `Handy` and `CornerFix`.
*   **Mesh Networks and Decentralized Communications**: Delving into concepts of resilient and secure networks, with an interest in projects like `Reticulum`.
