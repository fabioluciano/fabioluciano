# Fábio Luciano
Cloud-Native Solutions Architect | Platform & DevOps Engineer

📍 Brasília, Brazil

👋 About Me
Hello! I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer passionate about building scalable, resilient, and efficient cloud systems. With over 50 public repositories and a history of contributions, I am dedicated to transforming complex challenges into practical and innovative solutions. My professional journey is focused on optimizing the developer experience and strengthening a robust DevOps culture.

My expertise spans **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, where I strive to balance performance and cost; **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, creating tools and processes that empower teams; and **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, automating and accelerating the software delivery lifecycle. I am an enthusiast of **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, building the foundations for developers to innovate autonomously, and a practitioner of **DevSecOps & Security**, integrating security at every stage of the development lifecycle.

Deeply involved in **Software Engineering**, I enjoy diving into code to create robust solutions. I am a strong advocate and implementer of **Kubernetes & Containers** for application orchestration, and an expert in **Observability & SRE**, ensuring that systems not only function but are understood and operated effectively. I believe that collaboration and knowledge sharing are fundamental pillars for the success of any project.

🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my focus is on deepening and applying the following areas:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing scalable, resilient, and cost-optimized infrastructures in multi-cloud environments.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Creating platforms and tools that simplify developers' workflows, increasing productivity and satisfaction.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing end-to-end continuous integration and delivery pipelines with automation and rapid feedback.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices from design to operation, ensuring robust and compliant systems.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing and maintaining internal platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity for development teams.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Designing and implementing software solutions with a focus on quality, performance, and maintainability.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating applications at scale and exploring advanced deployment and management patterns.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Building effective monitoring, tracing, and logging systems to ensure application reliability and performance.

🚀 Projects in Development
I'm always exploring and contributing to projects that enhance the development experience and infrastructure management. Some of my recent projects and contributions include:

*   **[tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A robust framework for tmux status bars, focused on productivity and customization. With over 400 stars, it's a project that reflects my passion for command-line tools.
*   **[integr8/integr8.me](https://github.com/integr8/integr8.me)**: Actively contributing to this external TypeScript project, focused on integration and automation.
*   **[github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A personal Python project to analyze and optimize GitHub profiles, demonstrating my interest in automation and data.
*   **[fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)** & **[resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)**: My website and resume projects, built with Astro and Typst respectively, showcasing my attention to professional presentation and exploration of new build technologies.

🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technologies and patterns. Currently, I'm focused on:

*   **CLI Tool Development in Rust and Go**: Exploring projects like `taws` (Terminal UI for AWS) and `witr` (Why is this running?) to build efficient and high-performance command-line utilities.
*   **Automation and AI Agents with Python and Go**: Investigating how artificial intelligence can optimize automation tasks, such as in `tally` (bank transaction classification) and `vibium` (browser automation for AI agents).
*   **Advanced Secrets Management in Kubernetes**: Deepening my understanding of `external-secrets` and other solutions for securely managing sensitive credentials and configurations in Kubernetes environments.
*   **macOS and Terminal Productivity Optimization**: Exploring tools like `Rectangle` for window management and `tmux-fzf` for a more productive terminal environment.
