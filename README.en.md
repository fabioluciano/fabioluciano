## 👋 About Me
With a career focused on transforming software delivery and infrastructure management, I am a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer operating at the intersection of **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**, and **Platform Engineering (IDP)**. My passion is to create environments where innovation thrives, ensuring an end-to-end **Developer Experience (DevEx)**.

Deeply knowledgeable in **Kubernetes & Containers**, **Observability & SRE**, and with a keen eye for **DevSecOps & Security**, I strive to build robust, secure, and efficient systems. My approach integrates **Software Engineering** practices with a strategic vision for cloud cost optimization and performance, always aiming to empower teams and drive agility.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my efforts and studies are concentrated on the following areas, always seeking to enhance delivery capability and system resilience:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps:** Optimizing costs, scalability, and resilience in cloud environments (AWS, GCP), with a focus on FinOps strategies to maximize value and efficiency.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx):** Continuous improvement of the developer workflow, tools, and culture to increase productivity, satisfaction, and reduce friction in the software development lifecycle.
*   🔄 **DevOps & Modern CI/CD:** Implementing and enhancing automated pipelines, a continuous delivery culture, and practices that accelerate the software lifecycle with quality and security.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security:** Integrating security into all phases of development and operations, from design and coding to deployment and monitoring in production.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP):** Building and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms to empower engineering teams by providing self-service tools and services.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering:** Designing, developing, and maintaining scalable and high-performance systems, focusing on distributed architectures and robust software patterns.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers:** Orchestrating and managing containerized applications, exploring the latest trends in cloud-native ecosystems and cluster optimization.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE:** Implementing telemetry (logs, metrics, traces) and Site Reliability Engineering practices to ensure the health, performance, and availability of production systems.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
Even with lighter public activity in the last 30 days, I continue to explore and maintain projects that reflect my interests in productivity tools and infrastructure. Highlights include:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)** (Shell): Maintaining and enhancing a robust framework for the tmux status bar, focused on customization and terminal productivity.
*   **[fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/fabioluciano.com)** (MDX): Developing and curating my personal website and blog, using MDX for dynamic content and focusing on Developer Experience.
*   **[fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)** (Python): A personal Python tool to analyze and optimize GitHub profiles, demonstrating an interest in automation and data.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
My curiosity constantly drives me to explore new technologies and concepts, especially in the areas of artificial intelligence and developer tools.

*   🤖 **AI Agents and Orchestration:** Actively exploring frameworks and tools for autonomous AI agents, such as `openclaw` and `Maestro`, with a focus on personal assistants and code automation (e.g., `claude-code`, `codex`).
*   🔍 **Kubernetes Observability and Troubleshooting:** Delving deeper into tools like Google Cloud Platform's `khi` for visualizing and analyzing logs in Kubernetes environments, aiming for more efficient diagnostics.
*   🦀 **Rust Development:** Continuing to explore the Rust ecosystem, especially in areas like creative coding (`nannou`) and music client development (`euphonica`), appreciating its performance and safety.
*   🏡 **Self-Hosted Solutions:** Investigating and experimenting with self-hosted music platforms like `feishin`, aligned with an interest in controlling and customizing digital environments.
