## 👋 About Me
I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect with a deep passion for transforming complex challenges into robust and efficient solutions. My professional journey is focused on shaping development ecosystems that empower teams and accelerate value delivery. With comprehensive expertise in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, **Software Engineering**, **Kubernetes & Containers**, and **Observability & SRE**, I am dedicated to building the infrastructure and tools that underpin innovation.

I am a relentless advocate for automation and engineering culture, always seeking to optimize processes and ensure the security and scalability of operations. My approach is driven by curiosity, constantly exploring new languages like Go and Rust, in addition to refining my skills in Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript to develop cutting-edge solutions.

With a portfolio of 56 public repositories and over 3000 starred projects, my profile reflects a continuous commitment to learning, experimentation, and contributing to the open-source community. I believe that technical excellence goes hand in hand with collaboration and the ability to demystify complex technologies for everyone's benefit.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my efforts and interests are concentrated on enhancing and applying the following areas:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing resilient and scalable cloud infrastructures, with a focus on cost optimization and financial governance (FinOps) to maximize ROI.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Crafting tools and platforms that streamline developer workflows, reducing friction and boosting team productivity and satisfaction.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing advanced automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices to accelerate the software development lifecycle, utilizing GitOps and efficient pipelines.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security into all phases of the development cycle (shift-left security), from design to operation, focusing on hardening, compliance, and software supply chain protection.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that provide a self-service experience for engineering teams, abstracting infrastructure complexity.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Developing high-quality, performant, and maintainable software, using languages like Go, Rust, and Python to build distributed systems and microservices.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating large-scale applications with Kubernetes, exploring the ecosystem of cloud-native tools and patterns for efficient container management.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing robust monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to ensure full system visibility, preventing incidents and optimizing reliability (SRE).

## 🚀 Projects in Development
My dedication to engineering is manifested through projects aimed at optimizing the developer experience and infrastructure management:

*   **[tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A comprehensive framework for tmux status bars, widely adopted and maintained, which significantly enhances the terminal experience. (⭐ 447, 🍴 73)
*   **[resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)**: My automated resume, built with Typst, demonstrating a commitment to automating personal and professional processes.
*   **[github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A Python tool for analyzing GitHub profiles, reflecting my interest in development metadata and optimizing online presence.
*   **Contributing to [integr8/integr8.me](https://github.com/integr8/integr8.me)**: Active participation in external projects, with recent contributions showcasing my engagement with the open-source community.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
The continuous pursuit of knowledge leads me to explore new technologies and approaches, with a current focus on:

*   **Rust in Embedded Systems and High-Performance Tools**: Delving into the use of Rust for embedded systems (like the `embassy-rs` project) and for developing high-performance CLI/TUI tools, such as email archivers (`bichon`) and AWS terminals (`taws`).
*   **AI Agents for Coding**: Exploring the potential of multi-agent AI orchestration to optimize and automate code development tasks, as seen in `oh-my-claudecode`.
*   **Advanced Kubernetes Optimization and Management**: Investigating tools like `descheduler` for resource optimization and `zot` for OCI image management, enhancing efficiency and security in Kubernetes environments.
*   **Declarative Configuration and Dependency Management**: Studying templating languages like `jsonnet` and declarative update tools like `updatecli` to manage complex configurations and dependencies more robustly.
*   **System Hardening and Infrastructure Security**: Focusing on Ansible collections for hardening Linux and SSH systems (`ansible-collection-hardening`), reinforcing infrastructure security.
