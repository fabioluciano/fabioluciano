## 👋 About Me
I'm Fábio Luciano, a Solutions Architect and Platform Engineer passionate about transforming complex challenges into robust and efficient solutions. My professional journey is driven by a continuous pursuit of innovation in **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**, **DevSecOps & Security**, **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, **Software Engineering**, **Kubernetes & Containers**, and **Observability & SRE**.

With extensive experience in infrastructure and automation, I am dedicated to building ecosystems that empower development teams to deliver value with greater agility and security. I am an open-source enthusiast, with a history of contributing to and maintaining tools that simplify developers' daily lives, such as the popular `tmux-powerkit`.

My approach is pragmatic and results-oriented, always striving for technical excellence and cost optimization in cloud environments. I believe that security should be intrinsic to the development cycle, and developer experience, a top priority.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests
Currently, my energy is focused on enhancing and exploring the following areas:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing and optimizing scalable cloud infrastructures, with a strong emphasis on cost governance and operational efficiency.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Crafting tools and processes that streamline developers' workflows, reducing friction and boosting productivity.
*   🔄 **DevOps & Modern CI/CD**: Implementing advanced Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines, automating the entire software lifecycle.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices from the earliest stages of development, ensuring compliance and resilience across all layers.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Developing and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that abstract infrastructure complexity, accelerating application development.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Applying robust software design principles and clean code patterns to build reliable and high-performance systems.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating large-scale applications with Kubernetes, exploring the latest trends in container management and cloud-native ecosystems.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing monitoring, logging, and tracing solutions to ensure system health and performance, while applying Site Reliability Engineering principles for high availability.

## 🚀 Projects in Development
My passion for software engineering and automation is reflected in projects that aim to optimize workflows and explore new technologies. Currently, I'm focused on:

*   **`tmux-powerkit`** (Shell): Maintaining and enhancing this popular framework for the tmux status bar, offering a highly customizable and efficient terminal experience.
*   **`integr8/integr8.me`**: Actively contributing to this external project, focusing on enhancements and new features that expand its integration capabilities.
*   **`resume.fabioluciano.com`** (Typst): Exploring document automation with Typst to programmatically generate resumes, an engineering exercise to optimize what shouldn't require manual effort.
*   **`fabioluciano.com`** (Astro): Building and maintaining my personal website using Astro, with a focus on performance and a modern architecture for content.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
The technological landscape is constantly evolving, and I'm always seeking to expand my knowledge. Currently, I'm exploring and delving deeper into:

*   **eBPF & Low-Level Observability Tools**: Investigating how eBPF can be used for performance and security insights in Linux systems and containers, inspired by projects like `loresuso/psc`.
*   **Rust in Embedded and Systems Contexts**: Diving into the world of Rust for embedded development (`embassy-rs/embassy`) and high-performance system applications, leveraging its safety and concurrency.
*   **AI Agents and Orchestration with Claude**: Exploring the potential of AI agents for automating development tasks and coding, focusing on tools like `different-ai/openwork` and `oh-my-claudecode`.
*   **System and Infrastructure Hardening with Ansible**: Deepening my understanding of security automation and compliance for Linux environments and services like SSH and Nginx, using Ansible collections such as `dev-sec/ansible-collection-hardening`.
*   **Advanced Configuration Management with Jsonnet**: Exploring Jsonnet for robust and functional configuration templating, aiming to manage complexity in cloud-native environments.
