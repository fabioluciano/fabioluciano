## 👋 About Me

I'm Fábio Luciano, a Brazilian Solutions Architect passionate about transforming complex challenges into efficient and scalable engineering solutions. With a solid foundation in Software Engineering, I act as a bridge between business needs and technical excellence, designing and implementing robust systems that drive innovation.

My expertise spans **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**, where I aim to optimize not only performance and resilience but also cost efficiency in cloud environments. I'm an enthusiast of **Developer Experience (DevEx)**, focused on creating tools and processes that empower developers, making their work more productive and rewarding. This is complemented by my deep involvement in **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**, ensuring continuous and automated deliveries.

Furthermore, I dedicate myself to **DevSecOps & Security**, integrating security from the early stages of development. I'm a practitioner of **Platform Engineering (IDP)**, building internal platforms that abstract infrastructure complexity, and I master the **Kubernetes & Containers** ecosystem for workload orchestration. My passion for **Observability & SRE** allows me to ensure system reliability and performance, always seeking to enhance both user and developer experience. My curiosity constantly drives me to explore new frontiers, such as the use of Rust and Go in high-performance systems and automation.

## 🎯 Current Focus & Interests

Currently, my main areas of focus and interest include:

*   ☁️ **Cloud Architecture & FinOps**: Designing scalable, resilient, and secure cloud solutions, with a keen eye on cost optimization and financial governance in the cloud.
*   👨‍💻 **Developer Experience (DevEx)**: Developing tools, processes, and platforms that simplify the development lifecycle, increasing engineers' productivity and satisfaction.
*   🔄 **Modern DevOps & CI/CD**: Implementing end-to-end continuous integration and delivery pipelines, automating testing, deployments, and ensuring software quality.
*   🔐 **DevSecOps & Security**: Integrating security practices at all stages of the development lifecycle, from conception to operation, to build inherently secure systems.
*   🏗️ **Platform Engineering (IDP)**: Building and maintaining Internal Developer Platforms that provide self-service capabilities, abstracting infrastructure complexity and accelerating value delivery.
*   ⚙️ **Software Engineering**: Designing and implementing robust, efficient, and high-quality software systems, with a focus on scalable and maintainable architectures.
*   ☸️ **Kubernetes & Containers**: Orchestrating containerized applications at scale, managing Kubernetes clusters, and exploring the latest innovations in container technologies.
*   📊 **Observability & SRE**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting solutions to ensure the reliability, performance, and availability of production systems.

## 🚀 Projects in Development

While my recent public commit activity is light, I'm constantly exploring and contributing to projects that drive productivity and platform engineering:

*   **[fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit](https://github.com/fabioluciano/tmux-powerkit)**: A robust framework for the tmux status bar, enhancing the terminal experience. (Shell)
*   **[fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer](https://github.com/fabioluciano/github-profile-analyzer)**: A Python tool for analyzing GitHub profiles, reflecting my interest in automation and data insights. (Python)
*   **[fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com](https://github.com/fabioluciano/resume.fabioluciano.com)**: My resume as an engineering exercise, using Typst, exemplifying my approach to "automating what shouldn't require effort." (Typst)
*   **Contributing to [integr8/integr8.me](https://github.com/integr8/integr8.me)**: Actively contributing to external open-source projects, with a focus on TypeScript.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

I'm always seeking new technologies and approaches to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge. Currently, I'm exploring:

*   **Secrets Management with `external-secrets`**: Diving deep into secrets management solutions for Kubernetes, ensuring robust DevSecOps practices.
*   **Rust CLIs for Infrastructure**: Exploring tools like `taws` for more efficient and performant interactions with AWS infrastructure directly from the terminal.
*   **Automation and Agents with Go and Python**: Investigating the use of Go (`VibiumDev/vibium`) and Python (`davidfowl/tally`) for automating complex tasks and developing intelligent agents.
*   **Workflow Optimization with `tmux-fzf`**: Enhancing terminal productivity through the integration of `fzf` with `tmux` for a more fluid work environment.
